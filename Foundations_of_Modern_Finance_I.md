LEONID KOGAN: I am Leonid Kogan.JIANG WANG: I am Jiang Wang.Welcome to Foundations of Modern Finance.We are the instructors for this course.LEONID KOGAN: In this course, we'llintroduce you to the core principles and someof the most important techniques in modern finance.The global financial system is complexwith multiple participants including households,businesses, financial intermediaries,and the governments, among others.Yet, the diverse problems faced by these actorscan be understood and addressed using a unifyingframework and a relatively small set of fundamental principles.This framework forms the foundation of modern finance,and it is our purpose in this classto equip you with the concepts and tools necessary to handlea wide range of financial problems.JIANG WANG: Here, we would like to give a brief descriptionabout the structure and content of the course.Part one of the course has four sections.Section A provides an introduction to finance.Sections B, C, and D then cover the basicsof financial market, risk analysis and evaluation,and corporate finance.The introductory section provides the foundationfor the whole course.In lecture 1, we will develop a comprehensive and coherentanalytical framework to formulatethe fundamental financial challenges firms and householdsface and lay down the general principles wewill use to tackle them.In lecture 2, we will establish the key ideain solving the central problem in finance,which is how to value assets, cash rolls and projects.In particular, we will develop a general methodologyfor asset valuation, the arbitrage pricing approach,by using prices of assets traded in the financial market.We will then further develop this general asset valuationmethodology into powerful tools for the pricing of assetsor cash flows--in particular, how to use the appropriate discountrate properly adjusted for timing and riskto obtain the present value of a cash flow.LEONID KOGAN: In part B, we introducesome of the largest and most important financial marketsand securities, fixed income securities and common stocks.We discuss the main characteristicsof these securities and the markets where they trade.We then develop valuation techniquesfor fixed income assets and for equities.Although these assets are quite different in their properties,our approach to their valuation isbased on the same fundamental principle.We value financial securities relative to other assets,based on the principle of absenceof arbitrage or no free lunch.We maintain this common perspectiveas we explore some of the topics specific to each asset class,such as bond duration or forecasting of stock dividends.By the end of this section, you will learn the principlesand the core valuation methods used in fixed income and equitymarkets.In section C, we explore the notion of riskwhich is central to many problems in finance.In lecture 6, we'll look at how to model investment decisionsunder uncertainty and how to measure risk quantitatively.We introduce modern portfolio theory and risk managementthrough diversification.In lecture 7, we introduce the arbitrage pricing theory,which is a powerful framework for pricing for national assetsbased on their risk profile.This pricing framework is heavilyused across financial markets, including both equityand fixed-income markets.In lecture 8, we introduce the fundamental important conceptof market efficiency.The concept of market efficiency refersto the ability of markets to incorporate informationinto prices.This concept is central to modern financeand connects to numerous other topics,from firm financial policies to asset management.In this lecture, we define the notion of market efficiencyand discuss its uses and limitations, as well asrelevant empirical evidence.JIANG WANG: The last section of part 1lays the foundation for modern corporate finance.In lecture 9, we will establish value maximizationas the main goal in corporate financial decision making.We will then apply the general frameworkfor financial analysis to major corporate financial decisions,including capital budgeting, financing, payout,and risk management.Lecture 10 focuses on the real investment or capital budgetingdecisions of the firm, its most fundamental and importantdecisions.Here, we apply the asset valuation tools developedearlier in the course to project valuation and capitalbudgeting.LEONID KOGAN: I have received my PhD in finance from MIT,and I have been teaching here for the past 20 yearsin various programs, including the Master of Finance,the MBA, the Doctoral Program, and Executive Education.The scope of my teaching at MIT includesthe Foundations course, on which this online class is based,as well as advanced electives and doctoral courseson capital markets and financial engineering.My research spans a range of topicsin asset pricing, macro finance, and financial engineering.JIANG WANG: Let me say a few words about myself.I'm the Mizuho Financial Group professorat MIT, where I have been for over 30 years.I've taught various finance courses in the MBA,Master of Finance, PhD, and executive programsat Sloan, including introductory courses, like this one,for many years.My research is mostly in the areaof asset pricing, investment and riskmanagement, financial regulation,and international finance.We will be working together with you throughout this courseand hope you will enjoy it.

PROFESSOR: When we think about finance, what comes to mindmay include bank accounts, stock market, mortgages,mutual funds, hedge funds, derivative securities,venture capital, private equity, and IPOs.Of course, these are all parts of finance--financial products, services, markets, and institutions.But in fact, finance is a lot more important and fundamentalto our economy and our welfare.It is really about how to make the best economic decisionsor how to best utilize the limited resources we haveto meet our economic needs.We would like to illustrate this point with an example.Suppose that you are a marketing manager at a company.You are thinking about a new marketing campaignfor your existing product line.Independent of the details of the plan,being online or through regular media,the ultimate goal is to increase future profitfrom increasing sales.Of course, the plan could cost some money.Let's assume that the cost of the whole marketing planis $10 million today.If launched, you will increase the firm's profitfrom new sales by $12 million next year for sure.To keep things simple, let's assumethis is the only benefit from this marketing plan.The overall cash flow for their marketing plan,which we also refer to as a project using a more genericterm, is given in the chart.A downward arrow represents a cash outflow--a negative cash flow.And an upward arrow represents a cash inflow, a positive cashflow.Your decision is whether to launch this project.How do you make this decision?It would be too simplistic to simply say,our net profit is 12 minus 10.That's $2 million.Thus, this is a good deal.This is because $12 million in new profits is next year and itcannot be simply net with the $10 million of cost today.They are money at different points in time,thus cannot be compared directly.But how should we compare them then?We can also view this as an investment,investing $10 million today and returning $12 millionnext year, yielding a sure return of 20%.Is a return of 20% a good deal?Maybe.Maybe not.It depends.In absence of other information, answers to these questionsmay become a subjective judgment.However, suppose now we know that one year bankdeposits offer a sure interest rate of 5%.Then we can answer this question easily.Clearly, the project offers a good deal.It gives us a sure return of 20%, whichis much higher than one can get from other investmentopportunities in the financial market,such as bank deposits, which are easily available to everyone.Thus by taking on this project, we are earning higher returnsand thus creating value for the shareholdersand the society at large.What if the interest rate in a market is 25%?Then clearly, this is not a good project.Shareholders can easily invest their moneyin a market to earn 25%, which is higher than the returnthe project gives.Investing in the project would be destroying valuerather than creating value.In the scenario above, label A in the graph,we only need to value a single cash flow, $12 millionfor sure in one year.How about if the $12 million is spread over the next threeyears, $4 million each year, shownin the plot as scenario B?In this case, we need to know howto value cash flows in different points in time.Given that the cash flow arrives in the future, most likelythey are uncertain.This is in arrow C, in which $4 million each year onlyrepresents our forecast of the cash flow.Its realization is uncertain.It can be lower or higher than $4 million.This is reflected also by the lighter blue color weuse to describe the cash flow.In this case, the assessment of the projectfurther requires us to know how to value risky cashflows in the future.This example leads to two key conclusions.First, a business decision-- in this case, a marketingcampaign-- ultimately is about howto value a project or its cash flows.This is fundamentally a finance problem.Second, the valuation is not a subjective exercise,but determined by the financial market.Of course, what we call a projectcan be any business activity.It can be a marketing campaign, like the example.It can also be an expansion of the current product line,an R&D initiative, an acquisitionof another business, an upgrade of the current IT system,the reorganization of existing workforce, and so on.So finance is the basic tool we need to value these activitiesand to make sound decisions.The previous example illustrates the fundamental importanceof finance in economic decision making.It is about the bottom line of any business activity.More generally, a business activityinvolves acquiring and disposing assets.Here, an asset refers to anything and everythingthat is of economic value.Its shape and form can be very generic.It can be a real asset, like a plant and machinery,or a financial asset, like cash and bonds.It can be tangible, like land and stocks,or intangible, like brand name, goodwill, and ideas.All business activities serve two basic economic functions.One, to grow wealth or create value, and two,to manage existing wealth to best meet future economic needsas shown by the previous example we have just discussed.Therefore, a business decision startswith the valuation of assets.You can't create and manage what you can't measure.Value is an objective measure.It is determined by the financial market.Valuation is the central issue of finance and businessdecision making.So the questions we would like to answer in this courseare as follows.First, how to value assets.As we've seen, all business decision makingsfirst require the proper valuationof the assets involved.Second, how should firms make sound financial decisions?For example, what projects to invest in?That's sometimes also called capital budgetingor real investment decisions.How to finance a project--that's a financing decision by either issuing financial claimsor securities, such as loans, bonds, and stocks.Third, what to pay to shareholders.That's often referred to as pay out policy.And also, what risk to take on or to avoid.And that's sometimes also referred to as risk management.And third, how should households make financial decisions?We will address these questions by developing and applyinga unified analytical framework and a set of basic financeprinciples.

PROFESSOR: Economic decisions boildown to the transformation of assets or economic resourcesin general we will start our analysis by first describingthe existing assets of an economic decision maker, whichcan be a firm or a household.To begin, let's first focus on a firm.A description of the firm's assetsit's also referred to as part of its balance sheet.The table on a slide illustrates a simple balance sheet.The left-hand side lists all the assets of the firm.It can contain cash, the most liquid asset, capital,the other tangible assets, and then intangible assets.Adding up the value of the firm's assetsgives the firm's total value as shownby the bottom row in the table.It's often the case that the firm does notsolely on its assets.For example, part of the assets maybe financed by borrowing, in which casethe lenders also have some claim on the firm's assets.Thus, the right-hand side of the balance sheetis used to describe the firm's liabilities,namely claims on the firm's assets.In the simple case we show here, the liabilitiesconsist of two parts, debt, denoted by D,and equity, denoted by E. D represents the lender's claimon the firm's assets, while E represents the equity holders'claim both in the form of their market value.Of course, if we add up all the liabilities, thatis all the claims on the firm, itmust equal all of the firm's assets or their total value.Thus, the total value of all assetsmust equal to the total value of all the liabilities.We can call this the conservation of value.Balance sheet properly describes a firm'scurrent financial status.Of course, a firm's economic or financial statusdoes not stay constant.It evolves over time.This evolution is driven by the firm's flow of funds.This flow is described by the firm's income statement.The income statement also has two parts, the source of fundsand the use of funds.Of course, the two must be equal.We can also call this the conservation of funds or money.For the source of funds, there are three parts,funds generated by the existing assets,such as earnings or interest from cash assets.We denote this by net income or NI.Funds raised by issuing new debt,such as new loans or bonds, we denote this by delta D.The third source of funds come from issuing new equity.We denote this by delta E. For the use of funds,there are four parts.The first part is investments into new projects, denotedby I. The second part is the couponinterest or principal payments on existing debt, denoted by C.The third part is the dividend payment to shareholders,denoted by Div.And the last part is taxes paid to tax authorities, whichwe denote by T.Given the flow of funds, the firm's balance sheetchanges over time.On the asset side, new investmentswill add to capital and possibly other items, too.On the liability side, new debt and equity issuesadd to existing debt and equity, respectively.Let's now consider a firm's financial decisions, whichare illustrated in the graph.On the firm's manager, the left-hand side boxrepresents the firm's business operations.The right-hand side box representsthe financial market.As far as the firm's bottom line is concerned,the manager's decisions lead to the falling five cash flows.Cash flow one-- funds raised from investorsby selling financial claims, delta D and delta E. Cash flowtwo represents funds invested in the firm'soperations or real assets, which is denoted by I.Cash flow three represents funds generatedby the firm's operations.It should be after tax.So that should equal to NI, the Net Income, minus taxes.The fourth cash flow, cash flow fourgives funds return to investors in the form of interestsand dividends.We denote that by C plus Div.Cash flow five gives funds retainedfor the firm's operations.And that should equal to Net Income, NI, minus Taxes, T,minus coupon payments minus dividend payments.Thus, managerial decisions reallyreduce to the management of four cash flows, cash flow one, two,four, and five.The first set of decisions about real investmentsor capital budgeting, this is shownby the left-hand side of the plotinvolving cash flow two and three.As we have seen before, how to make these real investmentdecisions really boils down to valuation of real assets.The second set of decisions involve financing and pay outdecisions, as shown by the right-hand sideof the plot involving cash flow one, four, and five.Of course, in order to make good decisions on these activities,we would need to know how to value financial assets.The third set of decisions are risk management decisionsassociated with cash flow one and four.And that involves transactions between the firmand the financial market.And of course, in order to make these risk managementdecisions, we would need to know howto value financial contracts.The objective for the manager is to create maximum valuefor shareholders.The right decisions in achieving this goal criticallyrely on how to correctly value assets, real and financial.We can use the same method to analyzea household's financial decisions,also shown in the graph.The left-hand side box representsthe household's real economic activities,such as working, private business,or investing in human capital, like education.The right-hand side box represents the financial marketand the financial institutions a household interacts with.Financially, the household's decisionslead to the following five cash flows.Cash flow one-- funds raised from financial institutionsor from holdings in financial assets,such as borrowing from a bank or selling the house stockholdings.Cash flow two represents funds or resourcesinvested in real assets.Cash flow three describes funds or assetsgenerated by real assets.Cash flow four gives funds returnedto financial institutions or invested in financial assets.And the last piece, cash flow five,describes funds and resources consumed by the householdor saved for future consumption.Therefore, a household's financial decisions reallyreduce to the management of four cash flows, cash flow one, two,four, and five in the graph.Again, they represent three sets of decisions,real investments shown by the left-hand side involving cashflow two and three.Making these decisions involves valuing real assets.Second set of decisions represent consumption, saving,and investment, as shown by the right-hand sideof the graph involving cash flow one, four, and five.Of course, these decisions rely on valuing financial assetsand how to best use them.The third set of decisions are risk management decisionsinvolving cash flow one and four.And these decisions critically rely on the valuationof financial contracts.The objective for a household is to maximize lifetime happinessor welfare, or sometimes we call it utility.How to achieve this goal relies on howto value assets, real or financial,and how to best deploy them to meet economic needs.

PROFESSOR: We now turn our attentionto the valuation of assets.The asset can be a real asset like an investment projector a financial asset like a bond or stock.Each asset is fully defined by its future cash flow.Its cash flow can have many pieces occurringat different points in time from time 0, which is today,to times 1, 2, et cetera.To be concrete, we can describe an asset's cash flowin the table, listing each piece of outflow and inflowover the asset's lifespan.Let the initial cash flow be CF0,which can be negative in the case of initial investment.The cash flow in year 1 be CF1 and so on.The valuation of an asset is thenequivalent to the valuation of its cash flow.For convenience, sometimes we alsodraw a flow chart to describe a cash flowas shown in the figure here like what wedid in our beginning example.Again, a downward arrow represents a cash outflow,while an upward arrow represents a cash inflow.When we consider a cash flow, other than its magnitude,it has two important characteristics.The first is time.Let's now consider two cash flowsin the first example on the slide,$1,000 today and $1,000 next year.They have the same magnitude but arrive at different times.Which one would you prefer?In general, people are not indifferent between these twocash flows.The fact that market interest rates are typically positivesuggest that market participants on averageprefers $1,000 today over later.We will return to this topic later.But for the moment, the point we want to establishis simply that the timing of a cash flow matters.How much it matters is what we referto as the time value of money.The second important characteristic of a cash flowis its risk.To see this, let's consider the two cash flowsin the second example on the slide.Cash flow one on the left-hand side is $1,000 for sure.There's no uncertainty here.Cash flow two, which is on the right-hand side,will be $2,000 or $0 with equal chances.The expected value of this cash flowis still 1,000, same as the first one.But it is risky.Which one of these two cash flows would you prefer?Different people may have different preferences.In the market often, cash flow two, which is risky,will be selling for a lower price than cash flow one.We will spend more time to understand this differencelater.But for now, the key point for usis that the uncertainty or risk of a cash flowmatters for its valuation.How much it matters is often called the risk premium.Therefore, we conclude that time and riskare the two key elements in financebecause they are critical in the valuation of assets.How can we value or price a cash flow on an asset then?We will devote a lot of time to developa set of tools and techniques to help us solving this problem.For now, we will use a couple of simple examplesto illustrate the key idea behind our general approach.Let's consider an asset which yields a cash flow in oneyear of a sure value of $1,000.How much is it worth today?In order to have an objective valuation,we can look into the financial market for similar assetsand their prices.Suppose that assets or cash flowstraded in the financial market with the same timing and riskoffer a return of 5%.A good example of these assets would be one year US governmentbonds.The prices of these bonds then will give usa market-based valuation for the cash flowthat we would like to value.Let's think about the following.A potential buyer of the asset alsoexpects a sure return of 5%, the same as what the one yearUS government bonds offer.Let the price of the asset we like to value be x.Then x times 1 plus the expected 5% of returnshould equal to the payoff in one year, which is the $1,000.Solving for x, the current price gives us 1,000 divide by 1plus 5%, and that is $952.This gives us the assets current market value.What if the asset can be traded at a higher price, say 960?This will then lead to what we call a free lunch.Let's consider the following set of trades.First, buy $952 worth of one-year US treasurybonds, which will pay $1,000 in one yearat a 5% interest rate, the same as the asset.Next, we sell this sure cash flowof $1,000 in one year for $960 today.These two trades will net a positive cash flow today,which is 960 minus 952.That equals $8.There will be no future cash flows.This is a free lunch, a no-risk profitable opportunity.Naturally, free lunches will be eaten very quicklyin the effective financial market.In particular, sophisticated market participantswill make these trades at large quantitiesuntil the price deviation disappears.Therefore, if there are no frictions, thatis, hurdles preventing free lunches to be taken,such as trading costs and constrains,the price of the asset can't be higher than $952.What if the price of this cash flow is below $952?Or in this case, we will also have a free lunch.All we have to do is to reverse the trades wedid in the previous situation.I will leave that as an exercise for you.To summarize, given the prices of similar assets tradedin the market, the price of a sure cash flowof $1,000 in one year must be exactly$952, not higher, not lower.This example gives us the key idea in asset valuation.In order to value an asset, we can find a traded assetwith the same cash flow in the market.The price of the traded asset thenshould give the current market value of the assetunder consideration.The logic behind this idea comes from the factthat an effective financial market should notallow free lunches.

#### 415-1x_Lec_1-4_05-en

PROFESSOR: The idea of no free lunchis essential in asset valuation.Thus, we will develop it a bit more formally.A free lunch, or an arbitrage opportunityin the financial market, is a setof trades based only market information, suchthat it meets three conditions.First, it requires non-positive initial investment.The initial investment could be negative,meaning a cash inflow.Two, it yields non-negative future payoffs,at least with some likelihood.Third, at least one of the above inequalities is strict.It is important to emphasize that these trades are basedon market information only.They do not rely on any private information.Therefore, if they do exist, theywill be available to everybody participating in a market.Let's now consider a simple exampleof an arbitrage opportunity.Suppose that Citibank, a large commercial bank,offers a 12 month lending rate of 1%.Chase, another large commercial bank,is selling 12 month certificates of deposit, also called a CD,at an interest rate of 1.125%, assuming no default riskon Chase CDs.These two prices then present an arbitrage opportunity.Let's consider the following set of trades.First, borrow money from Citibank,say $100, at the interest rate of 1%.Buy $100 of CD from Chase at 1.125% interest rate.The current cash flow in net is zero.We don't need to put in any money.In one year we will receive $101.125 from Chase,earning the 1.125% interest.After paying 101 to Citi, with 1% interest,we are left with $0.125 for sure.This is a free lunch.If so, we'll do more than $100.How about $100 million?Well, in that case, the arbitrage profitwould be $125,000.How about more?Well, as we keep borrowing money from Citi,it will eventually raise its lending rate above 1%.As we buy more CDs from Chase, itwill start lowering the CD rate below 1.125%.Soon, the rates converge, the arbitrage opportunitydisappears, and the market stabilizes.Now let's consider another example.Suppose that IBM shares are traded on the New York StockExchange, or NYSE, at $195 per share.And they are also traded on London Stock Exchange, or LSE.At 120 pounds per share.And the pound dollar exchange rate is $1.50 for a pound.In absence of any frictions, this situationalso provides an arbitrage opportunity.Let's consider the following set of trades.Sell one share of IBM on NYSE, yielding $195.Converting the $195 into pounds, at $1.50 per pound,that's going to give us 130 pounds.Buying one share of IBM on LSE, costing 120 pounds, in net,we are left with 10 pounds today with zero net cashroll in the future.One share sold in New York is offset by the oneshare bought in London.Clearly this is an arbitrage.Giving us 10 pounds today with no future cash flows.Of course, as we carry out these arbitrage tradesat large quantities, the IBM share price on NYSEwill decrease, as we're selling IBM shares there,and its price on LSE will increase until the arbitrageopportunity disappears.Such a process, as you can imagine,happens almost instantaneously with automated tradingthese days.Therefore, as a good first order approximation,there should be no arbitrage opportunities in the wellfunctioning financial market.

PROFESSOR: Now, let's return to the basic valuation problem.In example one, we considered a safe cash flow.What if it's risky?We can apply the same idea.Suppose that we're looking at an asset that yields a risky cashflow in one year of an expected a value of $1,000.How much is it worth today?Again, we'll look into the financial market.Suppose that assets traded in the financial marketwith the same timing and risk offeran expected return of 10%.Assets like this could be stocks of similar risks.With that information, let's thinkabout a potential buyer of the asset under consideration.She would also expect an annual return of 10%because she is bearing the same on the risk.Let the price of this risky asset be x.And again, x times 1 plus 10%, the expected returnon this kind of assets, should equal to $1,000.That's the expected payoff from this asset.This will gives us the current market value for this assetto be $1,000 divided by 1 plus 10%, the expectedrate of return.This gives us $909.This should be the current marketvalue for this risky cash flow of $1,000 in one year.Summarizing what we have learned from the two examples,we arrive at the following three important results.First, in the well-functioning, meaning frictionless,financial market, there should be no arbitrage opportunities.This is also referred to as the no arbitrage conditionfor the financial market, a key idea in no analysis.This is simply because in absenceof any cause or restrictions, any arbitrage opportunitywill be eliminated quickly, often instantaneously,by investors choice to take advantage of them.In reality, however, there could befrictions in the market such as transaction costs, tradingconstraints, information asymmetry.These frictions can hinder the workings of market forces.For example, you may see prices in the market whichseem to allow arbitrage, but various costscan prevent the actual arbitrage trades from being profitable.In this case, we make three observations.First, strictly speaking, these are notto arbitrage opportunities.In the presence of frictions such as trading costs,we also need to include these costs in defining an arbitrage.Two, the extent that frictions are not very severe,at least for some market participants, the no arbitrageconditions should still hold pretty well at leastas a first order approximation.Three, if we see substantial and persistent violationsof no arbitrage condition, they are usually notsustainable because investors will eventuallyfind ways to overcome the frictionsand take advantage of the arbitrage opportunity.We will return to these points later in this lecture.We should also point out that we don'tneed all market participants to face limited frictions.It is sufficient if only some of them do.Second, from the no arbitrage condition,we can also conclude that assets with the same payoffsshould have the same prices.This is also called the Law of One Price.Obviously, violations of Law of One Price or LOPalso violate the no arbitrage condition.You may have seen LOP in other economic contextslike international trade.The difference is that in a mature financial market,it actually works pretty well.The reason is, again, that in the financial market,frictions are much less significant.Third, with the rich and well-functioningfinancial market, all assets can be valued or pricedby the market or the prices of traded assets.Here, rich means that there is a large setof traded assets with cash flows covering the whole rangein time and risk.We'll be more specific about this pointin our later discussions.For now, it is sufficient to point outthat in the global financial market,there are tens if not hundreds of thousandsof primary financial securities, such as bonds, stocks,and asset backed securities traded in very liquid markets,not to mention our limited number of derivative securitiesand financial contracts.The financial market is indeed a rich and fast expandinguniverse.We will return to this topic soon.

PROFESSOR: From our discussion so far,we have arrived at two basic conclusions.First, business decisions boil down to how to value assets.And two, asset valuation is determinedby the financial market.Therefore, the financial market is playinga central role in the economy.It is where asset prices are determinedwhich are guiding the decisions of firms and householdsat the micro level and the allocation of resourcesacross different economic activities at the macro level.For this reason, we will spend a large part of the courseto study the financial market.Before now, we would like to take a broad perspectiveon the fundamental functions of the financial marketin economy.Generally speaking, an economy consists of three markets--the labor market, the product market,and the financial market, broadlydefined which also includes financial intermediaries.The first two markets are sometimes also referred toas the real economy.The end players in these markets are householdsand non-financial firms.Financial firms are typically includedas part of the broad financial market,therefore going forward what we call firms will typicallyrefer to non-financial firms just for simplicity.Firms and households participate in the labor and product marketto produce and to consume goods and services.In order to do so, they need the financial market.For example, they all rely on the payment systemto exchange goods and services.Firms often need to take out loans or issue bonds and stocksto raise funds for its production process.Households often need to borrow moneyfrom banks for current consumptionor save money for future consumption.These services are all provided by the financial market.It is through these financial servicesand the key role of asset prices in guiding economic decisionsand resource allocation that financial market is drivingthe economic activities.Therefore, the effective financial marketis the foundation of a modern economy.It is at the center of the economic universe.Let's now take a quick look at the general structureof the financial market.Roughly speaking, it consists of two parts.One, securities market where financial assetsare traded more directly, and two, financial intermediarieswhere financial assets or contracts aretraded more indirectly.Examples of major financial intermediariesinclude commercial banks, investment banks, mutual funds,and insurance companies.We can look at the financial market in slight more detail.The securities market consist of a large arrayof financial assets or contracts.They are roughly categorized by the timing and riskof their payoffs or cash flows.The first category is the money market.It consists of short-term debt securitiesissued by governments, banks, and corporationssuch as Treasury Bills, CDs, and commercial papers.These securities have relatively short maturities, no morethan a year, and low risks.The next category is the capital marketwhich consists of securities with longermaturities and higher risks.It can be further divided into two parts, bonds and stocks,with increasing maturity and risk.The third category is the derivative securities marketwhich includes forwards and futures, swaps, and options.We will examine each of these market in more detail later.Financial intermediaries are institutionswho mediate financial transactionsamong firms and households.They mostly own financial assets.Prominent examples of financial intermediariesinclude commercial banks, insurance companies, savingsand loans, as well as mutual funds, hedge funds, investmentbanks, private equity funds.The end user of securities marketin financial intermediaries are non-financial firms,households, and governments.Non-financial firms own mostly real assetswhile households and governments ownboth real and financial assets.

PROFESSOR: Finally, we want to summarizethe basic economic functions of the financial market.First, it allows market participantsto allocate resources to best meet the economic needs.The allocation is in two dimensions across timeand across different states of the economy.Let's consider two simple examples as an illustration.The first is allocation across time.A good example here will be a householdborrow money to buy a home.In this case, the household is moving future resources,like future income, to finance current housing consumption.The second example is allocation across different statesof the economy.Here, we can think of a household investingin stocks or bonds.Here, depending on where the householdis going to allocate its wealth, it'sactually shifting its wealth towards or awayfrom good states of economy.Second, the financial market provides a powerful mechanismto determine asset prices based on current information.This function is also referred to as price discovery.In order to illustrate the price discoveryprocess in the financial market, let's consider an example.What is shown in the left figure is a stock's price reactionin the US market when the firm announcesa decrease in its dividend.The x-axis is time.The point marked by AD is the announcement date.To its left are the dates before the announcement minus 3is three days before, and minus 10 is 10 days before.To the right are the days after the announcement.2 is 2 days after the announcement and 10is 10 days after.The y-axis yes the stock price change in percentage.A decrease in dividend is typicallyviewed as bad news for the company.We will return to the question of why when we discusscorporate finance issues later.Therefore, the stock price drops substantially for about 4.6%on average on the announcement day.There's nothing necessarily surprising about this.What is surprising however, is that the price dropsto the right level, that is by minus 4.6%, almost immediately.This shows the market is incrediblyefficient in figuring out what the implicationof the negative dividend news for the firmand in discovering the right new stock price.The figure on the right-hand sideshows the stock price adjustment in responseto announcements on dividend increases.In this case, the stock price increases by about 1%.Again, it reaches this level very quickly.This example demonstrates how the financial marketfacilitates the formation of asset pricesin reflecting new information on relevant economic fundamentals.We will return to this issue laterwhen we discuss the information or efficiencyof the financial market.In our discussion of the financial marketand its role in asset valuation, wementioned that a well-functioning marketshould be absent of frictions.Before moving on with this notion,we should have some clarification about it.Market frictions, also called market imperfections,typically referred to the following.The first kind of market frictions is transaction costs.They can come in different shapes and forms.For example, markets may be missing for certain assets.That means the cost of trading these assets is prohibitivelyhigh.Some markets may be there, but it'scostly to access them to participate in these markets.When we can trade in a market, wemay also have to pay trading costs whichmay include commissions, bid ask spreads, and so on.In some markets, we also face position or tradingconstraints.For example, there might be limits on how large a positionwe can take.The second kind of market frictionsinvolve information asymmetry.This could be information asymmetrybetween a firm's different stakeholders,like bondholders and stockholders.It could be information and symmetrybetween corporate managers and the financial marketor between different market participants.The third kind of market frictions are taxes.They include corporate taxes and personal taxes.Our analysis always starts with a financial marketwithout frictions as the benchmark.Actual markets do have frictions which will be consideredwhen needed.

PROFESSOR: We have now defined whatfinance is about and the two basic problems in finance.One, how to value assets and two,how to maximize wealth and utilize it to best meetour economic needs.In the remainder of this course, we will tackle these problemsin a wide range of contexts using the basic ideasand analytical framework we have laid down.In doing so, we will be applying a few simple principles,which we now describe.Principle number one-- there's no free lunchin the financial market.As we have seen that the idea behind this principleis quite simple--any free lunch, if it appears, will be taken advantageof by some market participants, which will theneliminate the free lunch.With the efficiency of the financial market,which means that investors-- at least some of them--can trade or create financial assetseasily in the market in large quantities.Such a process happened very quickly.It is important to know that the same cannot be said for othermarkets, such as the goods market or the labor market.Principle number two-- other thingsequal, individuals or market participants behave as follows.One, prefer more money to less.This is sometimes also caught non-satiation.Two, prefer to avoid risk.This is also called risk aversion.Three, prefer money now to later.This is sometimes also called impatience.More is better than less should be obvious.Risk aversion is easy to understand,and we will discuss it further whenwe do our risk analysis later.Impatience is less obvious, but also less importantfor most of our analysis.It's listed here mostly for completeness.In fact, as we have said, all we can and need to sayis that the market on average behaves this way.This behavior is consistent with the return and riskpatterns for various asset classeswith different timing and risk characteristics, which we willsee from the data later on.There is no reason nor need to assumethat everyone behaves this way.Principal number three-- financial market pricesshift to equate supply and demand.In economics, this is also called a market equilibrium.Given the strong market forces in the well-functioningfinancial market, prices quickly adjust to market equilibrium.We have already seen an example of thisin the case of price reactions to dividend announcements.Principal number four, market imperfectionsare central to financial innovation.Real markets do have imperfectionsin different forms and to different x degrees.They do cause inefficiencies in the market--for example, price deviations from no arbitragerelationships.These deviations also represent potential profit opportunities.Financial innovations to overcome the imperfectionsin the market lead to the realizationof these profits and their eventual disappearance.We will see plenty of examples of various innovationsin different situations.

PROFESSOR: In this segment, we'll talk about bonds.A bond is a promise to pay a fixed amount of money.Let's consider the following example.It's a bond issued by Ford, and it has a face value of $100.The current price of this bond is $97.The term is three years.And this bond will pay an interest,which we call a coupon.We'll assume that the interest is paid annually on this bond.Now, let's look at the timeline of cash outflow and cash inflowthat we get from investing into this bond.In the year zero-- right now, when we purchase this bond--we pay its price, $97.This price buys us the ability to get our money, or the facevalue of this bond of $100, back at the end of year threeplus the coupons or the interest that this bond pays.In year one, we'll get the first coupon,indicated as C1 on this chart.The coupons are usually quoted as a percentof the face value of the bond.The face value of this bond is $100.If the coupon is 1%, it would meanthat at the end of year one, we willget 1% of $100, which is $1.This will be our cash flow at the end of year one.At the end of year two, we will get the same cash flow.So it's the same coupon payment.Well, we'll get 1% of $100, or $1.That's our second cash inflow.Finally, at the end of year three,we will get our face value paid to us from the bond, whichis $100, plus the last coupon, which is another 1%of $100, which is $1.So the end of year three, we will get $101 paid to us.

#### 415-1x_Rec 1_Expected Returns-en

PROFESSOR: In this video, I will introducea concept of expected return.Suppose that, currently, Nikola Corporationis traded at $32 a share.We're given the probability distributionof what will be a share price of Nikola next year.Suppose, though, with probability 10%,the share price will increase all the way to $150.With 60% probability, the share priceis going to come down from $32 to $20.And with the remaining 30% probability,the share price will go all the way down to $2 a share.The question is, what is the expected return on this stockover the next year?And here, by return, I would mean net return.So first, let's compute what wouldbe the net return on Nikola stock price in eachof the corresponding cases, when the share pricegoes up to $150, up to $20, or to $2.So I will write down here net return, and I will compute it.So in this first scenario, the net return on Nikolais going to be $150 minus $32 divided by $32.See, if you compute this, this gives us 368.75%.So that is a very large return.Now, in the second scenario, the net returnwill be $20 minus $32 divided by $32.And you could see that, in this case,the share price declines, so the return's going to be negative.So it's going to be negative 37.5%.Now, in this last scenario, net return'sgoing to be $2 minus $32 divided by $32.And that's going to be negative 93.75%.So in this case, the share price goes almost to $0,so we are losing most of our wealth.Note that, by definition, net return can neverbe less than negative 100%.This would just mean that you're losingall of your initial wealth that you invested into the stock.Now let me define what expected return is.Expected return, which I will denote as Er.E stands for the expected, and this is the conceptfrom probability theory.This would be the sum of all probabilities of each givenstate, so state 1, 2, and 3, multipliedby the net return in each of the corresponding states.So p1 multiplied by the return that we'llget on the stock in state 1, plus p2 times r2plus p3 times r3.If we have more states of nature,we can write down the expected returnin a more compact way, as 1 all the wayto however many states of nature we have, let's sayn, p i times ri.So the probability of each of these states of naturemultiplied by the net return in eachof the corresponding states.So applied in our case, this would be 10% multipliedby the return that we get in this first state, whichis 368.75%, plus 60%--this is the probability of occurrenceof the second state--multiplied by negative 37.50% return plus 30% multipliedby negative 93.75% return.If you compute this number, this would give us negative 13.75%.So the expected net return on our investingin this stock of Nikola Corporation is negative 13.75%.Now let me also show you an alternative wayof solving this question.What we can do is we can find the expected price of Nikolastock in year one, and then use the current priceto find the net return.So by definition, the expected price of a stock next yearwill be the probability of each of the corresponding statestimes the share price in that state of nature.So in this case, it will be 10% multipliedby $150 plus 60% multiplied by $20 plus 30% multiplied by $2.If you compute the share price, we will get $27.60.So right here, you already can see that, in expectation,the share price of Nikola is goingto decline from the current price to what itis going to be, or expected to be, next year.Now to compute the net return, whichis taking the future price, the expected future price,we'll divide it by the current price minus 1.And so it will be $27.60 divided by $32 minus 1.And this number will also be negative 13.75%.So both approaches give us exactly the same final result,which is the net return on the stock of negative 13.75%.What it implies, this expected value or what we alsocall mean return, is based on our assessment of probabilitiesof different states and different pricesof share price of Nikola in each of those different states.What is the most likely return on the shareover the next year?

#### 415-1x_Rec 1_Financial Assets_Final-en

PROFESSOR: Financial assets include bank deposits,certificate of deposits, commercial paper,treasury securities, corporate bonds, stocks,and derivative securities.In the segment, we will discuss in detaileach of these financial assets.Bank deposits are money placed into banks for safekeeping.They include money deposited in the checking accountsand savings accounts.In the United States, these accountsare partially insured by the Federal Deposit InsuranceCorporation, or FDIC.The standard deposit insurance coverage limit is $250,000.They account holder has the rightto withdraw deposited funds as set forthin the terms and conditions governing the accountagreement.Typically, there are no restrictionson withdrawals from checking and savings accounts.Certificate of deposit, or a CD, is a financial productoffered by banks that allows a customer to deposit moneyfor a specific time period.So these differ from regular savings accountsin that the CD has a specific fixed term, often one, three,or six months, or one to five years,and usually a fixed interest rate.The bank expects a CD to be held until maturity, at which timethey can be withdrawn and interest is paid.Because money deposited into CDs are illiquid,interest rates on CDs are typically significantly higherthan interest rates on liquid accounts,such as regular savings accounts.Commercial paper is an unsecured, short-term debtinstrument issued by corporations, typically usedfor the financing of payroll, accountspayable and inventories, and meetingother short-term liabilities.Maturities on commercial paper typically last several daysand rarely range longer than 270 days.The average maturity of commercial paper is 30 days.Commercial paper is usually a cheaper sourceof funds than a short-term bank loan.The minimum face value is $25,000.And most commercial paper has a face valueof at least $100,000.The interest on commercial paper is typicallypaid by selling it at initial discount.Commercial paper is rated by credit agencies,similar to other types of corporate debt.In the United States, treasury securitiesare government debt instruments issued by the United StatesDepartment of the Treasury to finance government spending.Treasury securities are often referredto simply as treasuries.Treasuries are backed by the full faith and creditof the United States, meaning that the government promisesto raise money by any legally available means to repay them.Although the United States is a sovereign powerand may default without recourse,its strong record of repayment has given treasury securitiesa reputation as one of the world'slowest-risk investments.There are four types of marketable treasurysecurities--treasury bills, treasury notes, treasury bonds, and treasuryinflation-protected securities, or TIPS.The government sells the securitiesin auctions conducted by the Federal ReserveBank of New York, after which they canbe traded in secondary markets.Treasury bills are treasuries with maturitiesequal or less than 1 year.Treasury notes are treasuries with maturitiesbetween 2 and 10 years.Treasury bonds are long-term bonds with maturitieslonger than 10 years.The current longest maturity is 30 years.Interestingly, in 2019, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchinannounced an intent to issue a 50-year maturity,ultra-long bond.But as of 2020, these plans were canceled.A corporate bond is a type of debt securitythat is issued by a firm and sold to investors.The company gets the capital it needs.And in return, the investor is paid a pre-established numberof interest payments at either a fixed or variable interestrate.When the bond expires or reaches maturity,the payments seize and the original investmentis returned.A stock, also known as equity, is a securitythat represents the ownership of a fraction of a corporation.This entitles the owner of the stockto a proportion of the corporation's assetsand profits equal to how much stock they own.Units of stock are called shares.For example, as of April 23, 2020,Tesla Motors had 185,371,105 shares outstanding.Owning one share of Tesla would give you an ownership of 1divided by 185,371,105 shares, or 0.00000054% of the firm.Stocks are bought and sold predominantlyon stock exchanges, though they can be private sales as well.These transactions have to conformto government regulations, which are meant to protect investorsfrom fraudulent practices.Corporate stocks form one of the major asset classes.Today, many people own stocks either directly as partof their investment portfolios or indirectlythrough managed retirement plans.A financial derivative is a securitywhose value is derived from an underlying assetor group of assets.The derivative itself is a contractbetween two or more parties.A well-known example of a derivativeis a financial option.An option gives you a right to buy or sellan underlying asset--for example, a stock--according to agreed-upon terms.These terms include the time when the transaction happensas well as the price at which the assets canbe bought or sold.The price of a derivative securitydepends on fluctuations in the value of the underlying assets.Common derivative securities include forwards, futures,and interest rate swaps.Derivatives are commonly used to manage risks and hedgeagainst events that can adversely affect valuesof owned assets as well as to speculate and makebets on certain outcomes in the financial and other markets.

#### 415-1x_Rec 1_Financial Institutions_Final-en

PROFESSOR: In this segment, we willtalk about major types of financial institutions.The list includes commercial banks, savings and loansassociations, investment banks, insurance companies,and investment funds.A commercial bank provides services,such as accepting deposits, making personal and businessloans, including credit cards and offering basic investmentproducts, such as savings accounts and certificatesof deposit.Examples include well-known names,such as Bank of America in the United States,Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, or ICBC,and Crédit Agricole in France.A savings and loan association, or S&L,is a financial institution that specializesin accepting savings deposits and makingmortgage and other loans.The key difference between S&L and commercial bankis that S&L traditionally placed a stronger emphasison the residential mortgage loans,while many large commercial banks concentrateon working with large businesses by providing loans.In addition to providing residential mortgages,commercial banks also engage in mortgage loans targetingthe construction and expansion needs of regional, national,and international businesses.S&L's used to play a very important rolein the residential mortgage market in the United States.In the mid 1970s, their share of mortgages in single familyhouses was over 50%.During 1980s, the number of S&L's in the United Statesdecreased more than twice.One of the reasons was an increase in interest ratestogether with the fact that portfoliosof deposits and loans had different properties makingS&L's particularly vulnerable to increases in the interestrates.This situation is called duration mismatch,which we'll describe in the second half of this course.An investment bank is a financial services companythat helps corporations and governments to raise capitalby underwriting or acting as the clients agentin the issuance of securities.An investment bank also helps firms involvedin mergers and acquisitions, or M&A's, by advising themand providing capital needed to facilitate these transactions.Investment banks also have brokerage and asset managementdepartments.Unlike commercial banks, investment banksdo not take deposits.From the passage of Glass-Steagall Act in 1933until its repeal in 1999, the United Statesmaintains a separation between investment bankingand commercial banks.Other countries have historically not maintainedsuch a separation.As part of the Dodd-Frank act of 2010,the Volcker Rule asserts some separationof investment banking services from commercial banking.Today, most large banks have both commercial and investmentbanking divisions.For example, JPMorgan Chase was formedby a merger of investment bank JPMorgan with a commercial bank Chase Manhattan.An insurance company is a financial services companythat sells insurance products, such as lifeinsurance and property and casualty insurance.Insurance companies collect insurance premiumsfrom customers, which include both individualsand corporations, and pay out claimsfollowing insured events.An insurance company typically invests its capital thatcomes from insurance premiums.For example, insurance firms are someof the largest buyers of corporate bonds in the UnitedStates.Management of assets and liabilitiesis at the core of the business model of insurance firms.Finally, investment funds are investment vehiclesthat allow investing alongside other investorsin order to benefit from the advantages of workingand investing as part of a group.Types of investment funds include mutual funds,exchange trade funds, hedge funds,and private equity funds.Mutual funds and exchange trade funds, or ETFs,are currently one of the main vehicles for retail investorsto access diversified investment products.We'll talk more about them later in the class.A hedge fund is an investment fundthat trades in relatively liquid assetsand is able to make extensive use of more complex trading,portfolio construction, and risk managementtechniques to improve performance,while limiting risk exposure.An example of a well-known and very successful hedge fundis the Medallion Fund of Renaissance Technologiesfounded by James Simons.Finally, private equity funds is an investment fundthat directly invests in private companies,or they're engaged in buyouts of public companies,resulting in the listing of public equity.Over the last 10 years, private equity investinghas been one of the fastest growing industries in finance.

PROFESSOR: In this video, we'll talk about returns.I will define what is a gross returnand what is a net return.Gross return, by definition, is the future valueof an asset divided by its current value.And net return is the future valueof an asset divided by its current value minus 1.In other words, net return will be just gross return minus 1.And now let's consider a simple example.So suppose that you bought an apartment with a current valueof $200,000.And the future value of this apartment,let's say in one year, is $300,000.What is your gross and net returnon the purchase of this apartment?By definition, gross return, in this case,would be $300,000 divided by $200,000.And if we expressed that ratio in percentages,this would be 150%.So when we talk about returns, we express them in percentages.So the gross return on the purchase of this apartmentis 150%.Now, the net return would be just gross return,which is 150%, minus 1, or 100%, which would give us 50%.So the net return on the purchase of this apartmentis 50%.When we talk about returns, most frequentlywe mean just net returns.For example, if you hear someone issaying that a stock had a 10% return, that 10%is net return number.For example, if the stock price was $100 and it had 10% return,it means that its current value is $110.Now, both gross and net return are random variables.And the reason for that is because wedon't know what the future value of any of the asset is.So in this particular example, if the current valueof the apartment is $200,000, its future value of $300,000is just a guess.And therefore, since this future value isn't known,both gross and net return are random variables.

PROFESSOR: In this video, we will define what is varianceand standard deviation of the returned distribution.We will continue working with our example of Nikola stock.Let's first define, what is variance?Variance of return R is the expected squared deviationfrom the mean, meaning that it is expected squared deviation,which is this from the mean.And we know that this ER is the mean or the expected return.So you could see that, if the return neverdeviates from its mean, the variance will be zero.Otherwise, the variance will be increasing with the magnitudeof the deviation from the mean.Therefore, the variance is a measureof how spread out the distribution of return is,so let us compute this variance right now for Nikola stock.But first, let's write down this expression thatis written in expected value termsas applied to our case of this Greek distribution.So it's going to be sum of probabilities, PIs, multipliedby return RI that we'd get in a given state minus the expectedreturn, and this will be squared.So this is for all I's from one to N,however many states we have.Now, let's continue writing down this expressionand just applying it to our case.It's going to be P1 multiplied by R1 minus expectedreturn plus P2 times R2 minus the expected returnplus B3 times R3 minus the expected return,and we have to square all of these differences.So that we get the correct expression,and this is because we have only three states in this example.Now, recall that returns in individual states were this.So in this upstate or in the very positive scenario,the return was 368.75%.In the second scenario, the return was negative 37.5%.In the most adverse scenario, the return was negative 93.75%.The expected return was negative 13.75%.So now, we can plug-in all of these numbersinto the expression for the variance of the return.So it's 10% multiplied by 368.75% minus,and we're subtracting the negative number.So minus negative 13.75% squared plus 60% multipliedby negative 37.5% minus--again, we're subtracting a negative number.So we would effectively be adding them up,so 23.75% squared as well plus 30% multipliedby negative 93.75% minus negative 13.75%squared as well.The value of this expression equals to 1.69.Now, finally, let me compute the standard deviationof the return on the stock, whichby definition is the squared root of the variance.And therefore, in our case, it is the squared rootof 1.69, which is 1.3.Now, standard deviation of returns,which is often referred to as volatility,is often expressed in percentages.So in this case, the standard deviationof returns on this stock would be 130%.Let me make one important remark.Notice that I expressed standard deviation or the volatilityof returns in percentages.So same units in which we measurereturns and expect that the returns as well.But I haven't done that for the variance of returns,and the reason for that is that variance returns is measuredin percentages squared.And we could see it right here.Because when we are taking the deviations from the mean,we are raising them to power of two.Therefore, when it comes to variance,we typically just express it as a number and notas a percentage.

PROFESSOR: In this segment, we'lltalk about trading mechanics.Suppose you want to buy 100 shares of Uber.There are two ways of doing it.One, you can place what we call a limit order.And the second way is you can placewhat we call a market order.Think of a limit order as placingan advertising, which says how many shares and at what priceyou want to buy.And think of market order as responding to an advertisingposted by someone else.So saying that you will be buying 100 shares of Uberat the best price that is currentlyavailable in the marketplace.Let's consider a specific example.On the slides, we see what we call a limit order book.It shows us all available asking pricesright now of people or investors who arewilling to sell their shares.In particular, the top part of the slideshows four separate limit orders.It says that someone is willing-- oneinvestor, at the very top, is willing to selltheir shares at $13.08.And the number of shares they are willing to sellat this price is 200 shares.The investor right below is willing to sell also200 shares, but at a price of $13.06.Yet another investor is willing to sell 300 sharesat the price of $13.05.And the last investor is willing to sell 100 sharesat a price of $13.04.So this is the collection of all the offers of investors who arewilling to sell their shares.And they indicate the price at which they're willing to selland the number of shares that they are willing to sell.At the bottom, we have a collection of offersby investors who are willing to buy shares.The first investor is willing to buy 200 sharesat the price of $13.02.The next investor is willing to buy 300 sharesat the price of $13.01.And the other investor is willing to buy 200 sharesat the price of $12.99.So this is the collection of what we call bids or quotesfrom investors, limit orders from investors,who are willing to buy shares or the specified number of sharesat these specified prices.There is an important definition that wewill make based on this slide.So the difference between the best ask,which is, in our case, $13.04, and the best bid or the bestprice at which somebody is willing to buya share, $13.02, this difference between $13.04 and $13.02is called bid-ask spread, which isthe difference between, again, lowest ask and the highest bid.Now let's try to understand what happenswhen there is a market order that arrives to this limitorder book.Suppose that there is a market order, comes in,that wants to buy 200 shares.Now, the best ask is only for 100 shares.So somebody is willing to sell you 100 shares at $13.04.The next best ask is 300 shares at $13.05.So your order got to get executed in two batches.You will buy the available 100 shares at $13.04.And then you will buy the remaining 100 shares at $13.05.Now after your order is executed,let's look at how does the limit order booklook like after this order is executed.So we see that because we just purchased 100 shares at $13.04,there is no bottom line, which indicates that we actuallypurchased this 100 shares at this price.And the ask of $13.05 for 300 sharesright now indicates that there are only 200 shares availableat $13.05.Which makes sense, because we purchased100 of these 300 shares that wereavailable from the beginning.

PROFESSOR: As we have discussed, the central problemin finance or business decision making in generalis how to value assets or their cash flows.A cash flow, in addition to its magnitude,has two key characteristics, as we have discussed before.Its timing and risk.We are now going to develop a simple modelto capture the two essential elements in finance, timeand risk.We assume that the are two dates for the economy-- todayand tomorrow, or now and future.Denoting time by t, t equals 0 for today and 1 for tomorrow.Sometimes we also draw a horizontal lineto represent time.The timeline, as shown at the bottom on the right handside of the slide, the two dates are marked as 0 and 1.For day 0, there is no uncertainty.Before day 1, there is uncertainty.We describe this uncertainty by assumingthat there are N possible economic states at day one,such as boom or recession.We denote the state by s, and it can be 1, 2, or N,for state 1, 2, or N.The likelihood of these states aregiven by their probabilities, P1, P2, and PN.The N states can also be represented by the N branchesat time 1, as in the graph on the right handside of the slide.We assume that the possible states and their probabilitiesare known to all decision makers.The tree graph on the right hand sideof the slide with the associated probabilities,is also called a state space model for the economy.Ideally, the state space model fullycaptures the risk of the economy.The simple model described here may seem a bit too simplisticfor that purpose, but it can be extended easilyto allow many dates and many states, even the continuumstates.We will consider some of these extensions later.But for now, our main purpose is to have the simplestmodel to capture the key elements neededfor our analysis, and to develop the basic ideas, principles,and methods for asset valuation.For this purpose, we often even reduce the number of statesto two for simplicity.We now consider a financial marketwith no frictions in this economy,with a set of financial assets being traded.Assets can be traded at time 0, and the payoffsrealized at day 1.Let P denote the price of an asset at times 0,X denote its payoff at time 1.The value of X in general depends on the stateof the economy at time 1.It will be X1 in state 1, X2 in state 2, et cetera.X can also be represented as a vector of different payoffsin different states.It's also called a random variabledenoting unpredictable realizationsat some future time.A random payoff is fully defined by its payoffin each possible state and the corresponding probability.Mathematically, we can write it as a payoff vector,with each element of the vector denoting the payoffin that state, X1 to XN.Together with the corresponding probabilities P1 to PN.Assets traded in the financial marketcan have different payoff patterns.In general, there are many traded assets or securities.Here, securities refer to financial claims, contractstraded in the financial markets, such as stocks, bonds,and derivative securities.We first introduce some simple securities.Consider a primitive state-contingent claim,which pays $1 in a single state, S, and nothing otherwise.It is also called an Arrow-Debreu security,named after the two economists who first introduced theminto financial market modeling.Although Arrow-Debreu securities are notthe most divisible or common securities seen in a market,they do exist in mature markets.Introducing them here is to facilitate our analysisin the simplest way possible.As shown later, their actual existenceis not essential as long as we have a rich enough setof traded securities, like bonds, stocks,and derivative securities.We will denote the price of the Arrow-Debreu claim on state jby phi j.Phi j is also called the state price for state j.State price turns out to be a very useful conceptin our valuation analysis, as we willsee throughout this course.No arbitrage requires that all state prices are positive.A security that pays off a positive amount at leastin one future state must have a positive price today.Otherwise, we can construct an arbitrage.Since there are a total off N states,there are also N different Arrow-Debreu securities.A financial market is called completeif all the Arrow-Debreu securitiesare traded in the market.Complete market is a useful abstraction, as we'll see soon.It merely means that the financial market is rich enoughin terms of the securities being traded in the market.As we said in the introduction, thereare indeed tens of thousands of securities being tradedin the global financial market.For most of the applications we discussed in this course,assuming a complete financial market isa reasonable starting point.More discussion on this point willoccur when we develop more detailed risk and valuationmodels.

PROFESSOR: With a complete financial market,we can develop a general methodologyto value assets using the market prices of traded assets.We will start with a market in whicha complete set of Arrow-Debreu securities are traded.With the prices of these Arrow-Debreu securities,we can price other assets, securities, or cash flowsby using the first principle of finance;there is no free lunch in the financial marketwithout frictions.With the prices of the Arrow-Debreu securities,we can price other assets and the securities.To illustrate this idea, let's consider a two-state economyin which we only have two states for day one.We have three assets traded in the market.The first two assets are the two Arrow-Debreu securities,one paying $1 in state one, $0 in state two,and the other paying $0 in state one and $1 in state two.The third asset has a payoff x, paying $3 in state onein $5 in state two.The question is how is the price of the third assetrelated to the prices of the first two, namelythe two Arrow-Debreu prices, or two-state prices?In order to answer this question,we can think of the third asset as a portfolio of the first twoassets, namely the two Arrow-Debreu securities.In particular, we can think of itas being a portfolio of three units of the state oneArrow-Debreu security plus five units of the statetwo Arrow-Debreu security.In this case, the portfolio would pay $3 in state one,coming from the three units of state one Arrow-Debreusecurity, and it will pay $5 in state twoform the five units of state two Arrow-Debreu securities.The claim is that the price of this assetx is going to be given by the following equation, namelyits price should equal to three timesthe state one state price plus five timesthe state two state price.Since the third asset can be replicatedas a portfolio of the two Arrow-Debreu securities, namelythree units of Arrow-Debreu security one and five unitsof Arrow-Debreu security two.Then by no arbitrage, its price mustequal the price of the replication portfolio, namelyits price P must equal to three times phi 1, plus five timesphi 2.If this is violated, then agents can generate arbitrage profitsin the market.How?Well let's see.Suppose that actually the price of the third asset, P,is greater than three times phi 1, plus five times phi 2,then what we can do is actually to sell the asset three,gaining P, and then buying three units of Arrow-Debreu securityone, plus five units of Arrow-Debreu security two.The price difference, in this case would be positive,will be our current profit, and then the net future cash flowwould just be zero.So in the absence of arbitrage, wemust have the price of the third asset beingthe same as the cost of the replication portfolio.This example shows a more general idea,sometimes called the Law of One Price,which states that if two assets have the same payoffs,they must have the same market price.Applying this principle, then we canprice all the other securities using the pricesof Arrow-Debreu securities.All we have to do is to construct a replicationportfolio for a particular security,and then compute its price using the cost or the priceof the replication portfolio.Now of course, this all relies on the assumptionthat we have the prices of all the Arrow-Debreu securities.What if we have prices of a bunch of composite securities?Let's consider a simple example.Suppose that we have two economic states at day one.In a financial market, we have two traded securities,one is a safe government bond, which pays an interestrate of 5% with no risk.The other security is a stock that pays $90 in state oneand $120 in state two, and its current price is $100.The question is, what should be the proper set of state prices?Well let's see.From the price and the pay off of the government bond,we have the following equation; 100 on the left hand side,which is current price, equals to 105,its payoff in state one, times the state price for state onephi1, then plus 105 it's payoff in state two,times the state price of state two phi2.From the pay off in the price of the stock,we've got the second equation, 100, again it's current price,equals to 90, which the stocks pay off in state one,times phi 1, plus 120, the stocks pay offin stock two times phi 2.These two equations from the pricesof the stock and the bond allows us determine the two stateprices, phi 1 and phi 2.If we solve for the two state prices,we've got the following solution,phi 1 equals 10/21 and phi 2 equals 10/21 as well.Here's a special case in which the state prices are identical.This example shows that actually if wehave, "regular securities" like a stock in the monthfrom their prices and the payoffs,we can actually back out the Arrow-Debreu state prices.Now let's consider another example.Suppose there are two states next year.The payoff of a share of a stock and the probabilitiesof the states are $90 in state one, $110 in state two,with the probabilities being 0.4 and 0.6 respectively.We're also going to assume that the state prices for the twostates are 0.5 for state one, and 0.4 for state two.We would like to answer the following questions: one,what is the stock price today?Two, what is the expected rate of return on the stock?The stock price today can be computed easily.P should just equal to phi 1, the state price for state one,times X1, the stocks pay off in state one, plus phi 2, time X2.Plug-in the numbers, it gives us 0.5.The state price for state one times 90,the stocks payoff in state one, then plus 0.4 times 110.That gives us 89 as the current price of the stock.Next, we can compute the expected rate of returnon the stock, which is denote by Rbar.Rbar should equal to the expected payofffrom the start, minus its price today,then divide by its price today.It can also be expressed as the expected payoff of the spot,divide by its price today, then minus one.If we plug-in the numbers, that gives us 0.4 times 90,plus 0.6 times 110.For the numerator, divide by 89, its price then minus one.Finishing the computation, we willget the expected rate of return on the stockto be 13 divided by 89.Given the expected rate of returnon the stock by the market, we alsohave the following expression; the price of the stock timesone plus the expected rate of return on a stockshould equal to the expected payoff on the stock.Rewrite this equation, we have the priceof the stock being given by the expected pay off,divided by one plus the expected rate of return on the stock.Plug in the numbers, we have 102 for the numerator,and then 1+ (13/89) for the denominator.Finishing the calculation, we get 89as the price of a stock, which is exactly what we got before.So they are basically two ways to compute the stock pricetoday.One is by the state prices, the otheris by the expected payoff, then discounted by the expectedrate of return on the stock.Both methods give us the same answer.In general, in a complete market without frictions,we can value any cash flow by the no-arbitrage principle,the first principle of finance.Suppose a firm is considering a project yielding time one cashflow X, which is X1 in state one,X2 in state two, et cetera.Using the prices of Arrow-Debreu securities,we can then attach a value to this cash flow as follows.Its value should equal to phi 1, the state price in state one,times X1, its pay off in state one, plus phi 2,times X2, and so on.And that gives the current marketvalue of the project or the cash flow.This valuation formula encapsulatesthe relative or arbitrage pricingprinciple, which we are going to beusing for our future analysis.PV here is also called the present value of the projector asset or the cash flow.As we have seen in the previous example,the present value, PV, is also givenby the expected payoff of the assetand then the expected rate of return on the asset.The key idea here when it comes to value an assetis to find traded assets with similar cash flows,both in timing and risk, and thenuse their prices for the expected returnto value the particular asset we're interested in.

#### 415-1x_Lec_2-3_05-en

PROFESSOR: Using market prices, pricesor expected returns of traded assets,we can value a particular asset, project,or cash flow, its current market value or present value.We now expand on this idea to furtherdevelop some techniques to value a cash flowor to compute its present value.We will do so by starting with a couple of examples,the extensions of the simple examples we consideredin the introduction.We will start with the simplest case possible.That is, $1,000 of a safe cash flow in one year.The question is, how much should that cash flow be worth today?Let's suppose that in a market similar assets,namely safe assets, are offering an annual return of 2%.Think of a potential buyer of this cash flow.She would also expect a 2% annual return,same as what other safe assets offer in a market.Let the price she's willing to pay be P. Then wehave the following equation.Namely, P, which is the price she is paying,times 1 plus the 2% return she expects to get.That should equal to the total cash flow at the year end.That's $1,000.We can solve this equation for the price, P,which would equal to $1,000.That's the expected cash flow in this case with certainty.Divide by 1 plus the expected rate of return, 2%.If we finish that computation, we're getting P to be $980.This is a rounded number.So this is really what any investor in a marketwould be willing to pay, which is alsowhat we call the present value or the current marketvalue of this cash flow.It's really given by the expected cashflow from this asset--in this case, $1,000 for sure--discounted at the required rate of return of 2%.So this formula is sometimes also calledthe discounted cash flow formula, namely,the value of a cash flow when an asset isgiven by its expected payoff discountedat appropriate discount rate.Now of course, we realize this discount rate really reflectsthe time value of money.It adjusts for the fact that $1,000 is occurring-- not now,but one year from today.In the second example, we can assumethat this $1,000 in one year, it's no longer certain.But rather, it's risky.The question is how much should it be worth today?Let's again look at the market.Suppose that traded assets of similar riskoffer an expected annual rate of return of 20%.Well, given that, we can easily compute the current marketvalue for this cash flow of $1,000 in one year.The potential buyer, again, wouldexpect a 20% return on this by paying the current price--let's say, P.So by looking at this equation, P times 1 plus 20%should equal to $1,000, the expectedpayoff from this risky asset.The present value of this cash flowthen is given by this simple discounted cash flow formula,namely, $1,000 of expected cash flow discountedat the 20% rate of return, which isthe market's expected rate of return for assetswith this level risk.If we finish the calculation, thatgives the present value or the current market pricefor this cash flow of $833.As we noticed, the discount rate here of 20%is quite a bit higher than the 2% in the previous example,where the cash flow is certain.This actual rate of return reflects the risk premium.So the present value formula reallyproperly adjusts for risk by choosingthe appropriate discount rate for assets with same risks.From the two examples, we can generalize the current marketvalue of a cash flow or its present valueis determined by two factors.First, its expected payoff.Second, an appropriate discount rate,where the discount rate is given by the expected rate of returnon traded assets with similar cashflows in both timing and risk.In particular, the present value of a cash flowis given by its expected cash flow discountedat an appropriate discount rate, r bar.Therefore, the value of an asset or cash flowis determined by the financial marketthrough the discount rate or expected rate of return,or required rate of return.They all mean more or less the same thing.The discount rate here should properlyadjust for time and risk of the cash flow.The discount rate is also called the opportunity cost of capitalbecause it is the return offered by similar assets tradedin the market.

#### 415-1x_Lec_2-4_05-en

PROFESSOR: So far we have been lookingat the simple case in which there'sa single piece of cash flow occurringone period from today, say, in year 1.What about a cash flow that's goingto occur many years from today, say, in year T,and cash flow is CFT.Well, the present value of this cash flowcan be easily computed by taking the cash flow, CFT, discountedback at the right discount rate, r, T times.From now on, for simplicity, we'll use r instead of r barto denote the discount rate, unless otherwise noted.Let's consider a simple example.Suppose we are choosing between two cash flows: $10 millionin five years, or $15 million in 15 years.We can't quite just compare the magnitudebecause they occur at different points in time.Which one is better very much dependson how the market values different cashflows at different times.Suppose that the right discount rate is 5%.Namely, that's the expected returnfrom these kind of safe cash flows.Then we can easily compute the present valuefor these two pieces of cash flow.The present value for cash flow A, which is $10 millionin five years, can be discounted at 5% five times.That gives us a present value of $7.84 million.For cash flow B, the present value is $15 million,discounted at 5% 15 times.That gives us $7.22 million.Of course, in this case, cash flow Ais better because it has a higher present value.The previous example also shows howthe present value of a cash flow dependson how far it is from today.This is also shown in this graph.What's shown by that black line is the present valueof the cash flow, $1, when it occurs at different pointsof time in the future.Going from year 1 to from the left to year 20 and 30.As we can see, as the cash flow is farther and farther awayfrom today, its present value decreases.And it's simply because the discount.When it's far away from today, itwill be discounted many more times.The present value also depends on the discount rate,of course.And what's shown here also will behow the present value of a cash flow, say $1, for a given time,say, 10 years.And then when we change the discount rate from,let's say, 4%, which is for the black line,to 8%, which is shown by the dashed red line,or to 12%, which is shown by the dotted blue line.Clearly for the same cash flow, same horizon,if the discount rate increases, its present value decreases.So this is an important relationship for usto remember.Namely, when a discount rate goes upfor the same magnitude of the cash flow,its present value decreases.

#### 415-1x_Lec_2-5_05-en

PROFESSOR: The present value looksat the current value of a future cash flowby discounting back at the appropriate discount rate.We can also consider the future value of a cash flowtoday by allowing it to grow at the proper rate of return.Suppose that we have $1 today.What would be its worth in one yearif the interest rate is 4%?Well, we could certainly invest that $1 in the market,earning a rate of return of 4%.In one year, that $1 would turn into $1.04,where $0.04 will be the interest on the $1 initial investment.So $1.04 will be the future valueof $1 in one year at the market rate of 4%.What about its future value in T years?Well, we will just have to multiply 1 plus the interestrate T times.So the future value of $1 in T yearswill be 1 plus r raised to the Tth power.Let's consider a complete example.Suppose a bank issues a CD with an annual interest of 4%.And this is a 2-year CD.Suppose that you deposit $10,000.What will be your balance in two years?It would just be $10,000 times 1 plus the interest rate of 4%.Raise it to the power of 2.And in that, it will give us $10,816.And that is the future value of $10,000 today in two years.Business decisions often involve choicesbetween different alternatives.Each alternative may involve a stream of cash flowwith many pieces.Comparing these cash flows is not trivialgiven that they have multiple pieces.Let's consider the following example.A drug company has developed a new flu vaccineand needs to choose between two strategies.Strategy A is to bring to market in one year, invest $1 billionnow, and returns $500 million in year 1, $400 million year 2,and $300 million in year 3.Strategy B involves bringing the vaccine to market in two years,investing $200 million in year 0 and 1,and then returns $300 million in year 2 and 3.How do we make a decision between strategy A and B?In particular, how do we value, or compare,these two strategies, or their cash flows?Of course, the cash flows of the two strategies beingmulti-dimensional cannot be easily ranked.With the present value, however, the ranking becomes simple.The present value of a cash flow or its current market priceis a number, a scalar, which can be easily compared.First, we note that the present value of a stream of cash flowis simply the sum of the present value of each piece of the cashflow as given in the present value formula here.Suppose that the right discount rate is 5%.We can then price the two strategies easily.Let's first consider strategy A. Its cash flow in period 0is minus 1 billion.And here, the numbers are in millions.In year 1, it's going to return a positive cashflow of 500 million, in year 2, 400 million, in year 4,300 million.With the discount rate of 5%, we can easilycompute the present value of each piece of this cash flowstream.1 billion today is 1 billion today in present value.$500 million in year 1 would be 476.2 millionin present value terms.$400 million in year 2 would be $362.8 millionin present value terms and so on.If we add up the present value of each of the pieces,we get $98.2 million.That is total present value of strategy A.We can then do the same for strategy B.The cash flow from strategy B is givenby the second row in the lower panel in the table,and the present value is given by the third row.If we add up the present value of all the pieces for strategyB, we get $140.8 million.Now, with the net present value for strategy A and Brespectively, we can easily make a choice.Clearly, strategy B will give us a higher present value,and that is a better strategy.This example shows, if we can value each of the alternatives,the final decision becomes straightforward.Pick the one with the highest present value,assuming it's positive.We will see more detailed applications laterin corporate investment decisions.

PROFESSOR: Before moving on, we wantto talk a bit about the unit for measuring cash flows.They are typically measured in nominal dollars, whichwe call the nominal cash flow.However, what we really care aboutshould be the actual purchasing powerof the cash flow, which is also called the real cash flow.When there's inflation, which is present in almostevery economy, these two can be quite different.Let's consider a simple example.Suppose that inflation is 4% per year,and you expect to receive $1.04 in one year.What is the real value of this cash flow, namely,its actual purchasing power?What we need to do is to adjust for inflation.The inflation adjusted, or the real valueof $1.04 in one year, is given by its nominal value, namely$1.04, deflated at the annual inflation rate of 4%.That will give us $1, that is the actual purchasingpower of this cash flow in one year,namely, the real cash flow.In general, if the annual inflation rate is i,and if we are looking at a nominal cash flow, CFTin year T, the corresponding real cash flow at time Twould be the nominal cash flow discountedat the annual inflation rate T times.We can do the same for rate of returns.For rate of returns, the prevailing marketrates that we see in the market, for example, the interestrates quoted by banks, are typicallynominal rates of return.But what we should care about willbe the real rates of return, which are inflation adjusted.We can actually look at the following example.Suppose that we have $1 to be invested in a market,and the market interest rate is 6%, which is in nominal terms.That means that $1 we put in the bank would turn into $1.06next year.But if the inflation rate is 4% per year,the real value of this $1.06 is just$1.019 because we have to discount itby the annual inflation rate of 4%.This then gives us the real rate of return,which will just be 1.9%, rather than the nominal 6%.If we do this in general, the real rate of returnshould equal to 1 plus the nominal rate of returndeflated at the inflation rate i, then minus 1.In the case that both the nominal rate and inflation aresmall, we can also approximate thisby just the difference of the nominal rateminus the inflation.Let's now consider a concrete example.Suppose that sales is $1 million this yearand it's expected to have a real growthof 2% over the next year.Inflation is expected to be 4%.The appropriate nominal discount rate is 5%.What is the present value of next year's sales revenue?From the information given above,next year's nominal sales forecast should be $1 million,which is sales this year times 1 plus 2%, the real growth,times 1 plus 4%, which is the inflation.That gives us $1.0608 million in terms of nominal revenuenext year.Its present value should be $1.0608M discountedat the nominal discount rate of 5%.That gives us $1.01 million in present value terms.We can also do this calculation or valuationusing cash flows and discount rates in real terms.Next year's real sales forecasts will be $1 million times 1.02.That's the real growth that gives us $1.02 millionin real revenue.Then the real discount rate shouldbe 1 plus the nominal discount rate, dividedby 1 plus the inflation, then minus 1.Finishing that, that gives us 0.9615%That's the real discount rate.Then using the real cash flow and the real discount rate,we can also get $1.01 million in present value terms.What this example shows is that whenit comes to the valuation of cash flows,we should treat inflation consistently.If we're going to use nominal cash flows,then we should be using nominal discount rates.If we are using real cash flows, then weshould also use real discount rates to discount.It doesn't matter which one we use,as long as we use both the cash flow and the discount ratein the same unit, we'll arrive at the right answer.

#### 415-1x_Rec 02_Q1, Part A-en

PROFESSOR: So what is the return on this bond?Well, let's start with the definitionof what expected return is.It is the expected payoff that weget from this bond minus its price divided by its price.We already know the price of this bond, which is $96.So what's left to find is the expected payoffthat we get from investing into this bond.Well, the expected payoff can be foundas the probability of the first state, whichis 0.3, times the payoff that we getfrom this bond in this first state, $100.Plus the probability of the second state, whichis 0.4, times the payoff that we getfrom this bond in the second state, which is $100.Plus the probability of the third state, which is 0.3,multiplied by the payoff that we getfrom this bond in the third state, which is $100.So adding this up gives us $100.And it's very intuitive, one to expect the payoff on this bondis $100, because in each of the three states, we get $100.So no matter which state is realized, we get exactly $100.So therefore, the expected payoff is just $100.So now we know the expected payoff.We know the price of the bond.So we put them back into the return equation.And this gives us $100 minus $96 divided by $96,and that equals 4.17%.Note that this return of 4.17% is guaranteed.Why?Because there is no uncertainty in what payoffwe will get from holding this bond next period.We're going to get $100, regardless of which stateof nature is realized.So in this sense, this return is risk-free.Note that in the question, we didn't askwhat is the expected return.We just asked what is the return on the bond.Because again, this return is guaranteed to us.

#### 415-1x_Rec 02_Q1, Part B-en

PROFESSOR: Now what is the expected return on the stock?Well, again, by definition the expected returnis the expected payoff minus the price of the stock dividedby the price of the stock.Well, we need to find the expected payofffrom investing into the stock.Well, it's going to be the probability of the first states0.3 times the payoff that we get from the stockin the first state, 120, plus probability of the second state0.4, multiplied by the payoff that weget in the second state, $75, plus the probabilityof the third state, which is 0.3 times the pay that weget from the stock in this third state, $130.So this gives us $105, which is the expected payoff that we getfrom investing into the stock.Well, the expected return is then 105 minus 80 whichcurrent price of the stock dividedby 80, which gives us 31.25%.So, therefore, the expected returnfrom investing into the stock is 31.25%.

#### 415-1x_Rec 02_Q2, Part A-en

PROFESSOR: In this problem, we're given state prices.And we're asked to find the price of the bond.To find the price of the bond, wehave to multiply the payout that we get from this bondby their state prices.We have only two states in this particular case.So, therefore, the price of the bond equals to the payoffthat we get in the first state, multipliedby the price of that state, plus the payout that weget in the second state, times the price of that second state.It's $100 times 0.35 plus $100 times 0.55.That gives us $90.So the price of this bond today is $90.Notice this is a riskless bond.So one shortcut that we can take hereis just simply to add up state prices, 0.35 plus 0.55--that gives us 0.9--and multiply by the payoff that weget from this bond, $100 in both states.So that would give us $90.

#### 415-1x_Rec 02_Q2, Part B-en

PROFESSOR: The second question asks,what is the price of the stock today?To find the price of the stock, we again multiply the payoffthat we get from the stock in the first state,by the state price of the first state,plus the payoff that we get from the stock in the second state,times the price of the second state.It's 150, multiplied by 0.35, plus $40that we get from the stock in the second state, times 0.55.This gives us $74.50.So the price of the stock today is $74.50.

#### 415-1x_Rec 02_Q3-en

PROFESSOR: In this question, we'regiven a state-space model that hasthree states and three assets currently traded in the market.Asset 1 is a riskless bond with the current price of $95.It pays $100 in each of the three states.Asset 2 is a stock.Its current price is $150.And it pays $250 in state 1, nothing in state 2,and $500 in state 3.And finally, asset number 3 is another stock that is currentlypriced and traded at $100.And it pays $0 in states 1 and 2.And it pays $500 in the state 3.The question is, what are the state prices?To answer this question, let's startby writing down the pricing equation thatconnects the payoff that we get from an asset with the stateprices.So recall that in question two, wewere working with the following equation.So the price of any asset equals to the payoffthat asset pays in the first state multiplied by the stateprice of that state.And similarly, what that asset paysin the second state times the price of that second state,plus here we have three states in total,so we have the third state as well.So now we can write down the pricesof each of our three assets as the function of the stateprices and what these assets pay in each of the states.So let's start with the riskless bond.So we get 95 equals to phi 1 multiplied by 100plus phi 2 multiplied by 100 plus phi 3 multiplied by 100.Now for the second asset, or for our first stock,we can write down the following equation.So its current price is $150.And it pays $250 in the first state.So it's phi 1 multiplied by 250.It doesn't pay anything in the second state,so it's going to be phi 2 times 0, which is 0.Plus phi 3-- and I can put 0 here--phi 3 times 500.And finally, for the asset number 3, or the second stock,we can write down the pricing equationfor that stock, which is 100 equalsto phi 3 multiplied by 500.And so the remaining, phi 1 times 0 is 0.And phi 2 times 0 is 0 as well.So now we have this system of equations with three unknowns.It's a very easy system of equations to solve.So from the last equation, we get phi 3 that equals 0.2.We can plug this phi 3 into the second equation.And by solving that equation, youcould verify that phi 1 would equal to 0.2 as well.And finally, we can plug phi 3 and phi 1 into equation 1and solve that equation for phi 2.And so if we do that, we find that phi 2--and I will write it down here--so phi 2 would equal 0.55.So altogether, we get that the state prices, in this case,equal to--so phi 1 equals to 0.2, phi 2 equals 0.55,and phi 3 equals 0.2 as well.So this is the set of the state pricesin this state-space model.If we were to use the state prices to price these assetsagain given their payoffs, the way we have priced assetsin question two, we would have foundthat each of these assets, so the riskless bond, its pricewould be $95.The price of stock 1 would be $150.And the price of stock 2 would be $100.So altogether, this question teaches youhow to find the state prices from the givenprices of traded assets.

#### 415-1x_Rec 02_Q4, Part A-en

PROFESSOR: In this question, we'regiven a state space model that consists of three states.All three states are equally likely.The first question asks us to find the priceand expected return on asset x thatpays off $100 in the first state, $80 in the second state,and $100 in the third state.So let's start with the price of this asset first.So the price would equal to the payoffthat we get from this asset in state number one multipliedby the price of the first state plus the payoffthat we get in the second state multipliedby the price of the second state plus the payoffthat we get in the third state multipliedby the price of the third state.This gives us $100 times 0.2 plus $80 times 0.55plus $100 times 0.2 and gives us $84.So the price of this asset x right now is $84.Now, the second part of the questionasks us to find the expected return.To find expected return, the first thing we need to findis the expected payoff that we're expectingto get from this asset.Let's find it.So to find expected payoff, we are multiplying the payoffsthat we get in each of the states by their probabilities.In this case, all three states are equally likely,so probability of the first state is 1/3,second state is 1/3 as well, and the third state is 1/3 as well.So therefore, the expected payoffequals to $100 multiplied by 1/3 plus $80 multiplied by 1/3plus $100 multiplied by 1/3.This gives us $93.33.Now, to find expected the return,we're taking this expected payoff, $93.33,minus the current price of the asset dividedby the current price of this asset, which is $84.So 93.33 minus 84 divided by 84--this gives us 11.11%.So the expected return on this asset x is 11.11%.

#### 415-1x_Rec 02_Q4, Part B-en

PROFESSOR: The second question asks us to find the priceand expected return of asset Y. Asset Ypays off $100 in the first state,$100 in the second state, and $80 in the third state.Let's start with the price.The price of asset Y equals to the payoffthat we get from this asset in the first state,$100, times the price of the first state, 0.2,plus the payoff that we get in the second state, also $100,times the price of the second state,0.55, plus $80 that we get in the third state times the priceof the third state, 0.2.This gives us the price of this asset, $91.Now, to find the expected return,we again start with the expected payoffthat we get on this asset.The expected payoff would equal to the payoffthat it would get in each of the threestates times the probabilities of each of the three states.Because each of the three states are equally likely,the probability is, again, 1/3.So putting this all together gives us $93.33.Now, notice that the expected payoff on asset Y, $93.33,is exactly the same as the payoff of that we computedon asset X in part A. This is due to the factthat the payoffs from assets X and Y are similar in the sensethat both of them give us $100 in the first state.But in the second state, asset X pays off $80,while Y pays off $100.And in the third state, asset X pays off $100,while Y pays off $80.Because of the symmetry and because of the factthat each of these states are equally likelyand occur with likelihood 1/3, the expected payoff of asset Xis the same as the expected payoff of asset Y.So finally, to find the expected return on asset Y,we're taking the expected payoff, $93.33,we're subtracting the price of asset Y, which is $91,and dividing it by the price of this asset Y, $91.This gives us 2.56%.So the expected return on asset Y is 2.56%.

#### 415-1x_Rec 02_Q4, Part C-en

PROFESSOR: Let's look at state prices again.The price of state two is .55.And the price of states one and three is just 0.2.So the price of state two is much higherthan the price of states one and three.This means investors are willing to pay a higher priceto receive $1 in state two.Put differently, investors value of money in statetwo more than they do in states one and three.State two, for example, can be an economic recession.In recessions, many economic agentsmay receive lower income.For example, workers may receive lower wages,firms may earn lower profits, therefore, a securitythat pays money in bad states of the world, typicallyhas higher prices, because money in bad states is more valuable.Assets x and y pay off the same amount in state one.However, asset x pays off $80 in state twoand $100 in state three.While asset y pays off $100 in state two and only $80in state three.So therefore, y pays $20 more in the bad state,while x pays off $20 more in good state.So intuitively, this implies that the price of yshould be higher than the price of x.And because asset y pays more when money is more valuable,investors are willing to accept a lower rate of returnfrom investing in asset y compared to asset x.Indeed, as we have seen above, the expected return on asset xis 11.11%, while in asset y, it is only 2.56%.

#### 415-1x_Rec 02_Q5, Part A-en

PROFESSOR: In this question, we're given two options.We are offered $10,000 today or $11,500 in 1 year from now.To compare the two options, we have to compare themat one point in time.The easiest way to do that is to compare them as of now.What is the present value of option 1,and what is the present value of option 2?So the present value of option 1 is trivially just the valuethat we offer today.It's $10,000.Now, the present value of option 2,we have to find what is the present value of $11,500that we are receiving one year from today as of now.And for that we are given an interest rates of 8%.So the present value of this payment that we receiveone year from now is $10,648.So the present value of the second optionis greater than the present value of the first option.So therefore, we should prefer the second option.Let's try to understand why in this questionwe are preferring option 2 to option 1.Let's look at the interest rate of 8%.This interest rate represents our opportunity costof capital, which means what the rate of return wecan earn on investments that have similar riskas our sister's promise.So let's consider the following hypothetical scenario.Let's take $10,000 from our sistertoday and invest it in one of the assets thathave similar risk and therefore gives usexpected rate of return of 8%.Then the future value of this investmentwill be $10,000 that we invest today and 8% ratethat we earn at the end of this year, which gives us $10,800.So in this hypothetical scenario,if we take $10,000 today, at the end of the year,we're going to get $10,800, whichis lower that what we were going to get from our sister, whichis $11,500.And because these two options have the same riskand one gives us more money than the other one,we should be preferring the second option.

#### 415-1x_Rec 02_Q5, Part B-en

PROFESSOR: In part B of this question,we are asked again to pick between two options.Option one, which is the same, it gives us $10,000 today,and option two gives us $18,000 in 10 years.To choose between these two options,we are going to compare their value at one point in time.We're going to compare their value at present.The present value of option one is just $10,000.The present value of option two is $18,000received 10 years from now, discountedto present at 8% rate, which gives us $8,337.Since the present value of option oneis greater than the present value of option 2,in this case, we would prefer to take$10,000 right now as opposed to waiting 10 yearsand receiving $18,000.To develop intuition, let's look at this problemfrom a different angle.Let's take this $10,000 and invest itin an asset that has similar risk that our sisters promise,and therefore offers the same 8% rate of return.If we do so, in the future we will get $10,000 multipliedby 1 plus 8% raised to the power of 10, which gives us $21,590.So the future value of $10,000 invested at 8% for 10 yearsis $21,590.This is a higher amount then whatwe would receive from our sister in 10 years-- $18,000.So therefore, we are better off taking $10,000 todayand investing it at an 8% rate and receiving $21,590.10 years from today.

#### 415-1x_Rec 02_Q6, Part A-en

PROFESSOR: What is the average annual rate of returnthat we earned on this purchase?Let us denote by x the purchase price of this apartmentthat we paid for 20 years ago, and by 3x its present value,because it's tripled since the time we purchased it.To help us think in terms of present and future valuein this particular problem, let's shift the timeline 20years to present, and denote the starting point by tequal to zero, and this ending point by t equal to 20.Then x times 1 plus r raised to the power of 20would be the future value of this x in 20 years from now,and it has to equal to its actual future valueright now which is 3x.The only thing we have to do hereis to solve this equation for r.Well x is, of course, irrelevant here,so it cancels out from this equation.And then we are left with one plus r equal to 3raised to the power 1/20.Solving this equation gives us the interest rate of 5.65%.So the answer to this question isthat the average annual rate of return that we earnedon this purchase is 5.65%.

#### 415-1x_Rec 02_Q6, Part B-en

INSTRUCTOR: What would happen if we invested the initial amountx into the stock market and the stock marketduring this time period on average produced 10.2%annual return?Well, the future value of this x invested at 10.2% for 20 yearswould equal to x times 1 plus 10.2% raisedto the power of 20.And that would equal to 7x.Therefore, the initial amount of x would grow to 7 times, 7x,over this 20-year time period.So questions A and B give us the following information.If we invest x at 5.65% annual rate of return over 20 years,our wealth would grow 3 times.But if we invest it at 10.2% annual return,our wealth would grow 7 times.So therefore, relatively small differencesin annual interest rates may imply large differencesin wealth over a long time periods.

PROFESSOR: What is the expected rental revenue next yearin real terms?Well the current revenue they justrecorded for this year that just passed is $650,000.Next year your real revenue, or revenue in real terms,is the current revenue multipliedby 1 plus the growth rate.Notice that this growth rate is actually the real growth rate.And so in our cases then it's $650,000,the current revenue, multiplied by 1plus 3%, which is our real growthrate, which gives us $669,500.

#### 415-1x_Rec 02_Q7, Part B-en

PROFESSOR: The next question asks,what is the present value of your real rental revenuethat you expect to receive next year?To find the present value of real revenuethat we expect to get next year, wehave to discount it to present at the real discount rate.Applied to our case, this is $669,500, whichis our real revenue that we'll get next year,discounted to present at the 6% real discountrate, which gives us $631,604.

#### 415-1x_Rec 02_Q7, Part C-en

PROFESSOR: Question c: what is your expected rental revenuenext year in nominal terms?Well, nominal revenue in year oneequals to the current revenue multipliedby 1 plus nominal growth rate.But the question does not give usnominal growth rate directly.So we have to compute it.1 plus nominal growth rate equals to 1plus real growth rate multiplied by the rate of inflation.So we can use this equation to plug it into hereand, therefore, the nominal revenue year 1is going to be equal to revenue now multipliedby 1 plus real growth rates times 1plus the rate of inflation.Plugging in the numbers, we get $650,000 multiplied by 1plus 3% multiplied by 1 plus 2.5%,which gives us $686,237.50.

#### 415-1x_Rec 02_Q7, Part D-en

PROFESSOR: Question d, what is the present valuein nominal rental revenue next year?The present value would equal to the nominal revenuethat you receive in the year one, discounted to presentat the nominal discount rate.Now the question does not give us directlythe nominal discount rate.So we have to find it.To find a nominal discount rate, we use the following equation.1 plus the nominal discount rate would equal to 1plus real discount rate multiplied by 1plus the rate of inflation.Plugging this equation into here,we'll get nominal revenue in the year 1 divided by 1plus real discount rates multipliedby 1 plus rate of inflation, which gives us$686,237.50 divided by 1 plus 6%, which is the real discountrate multiplied by 1 plus 2.5%, which is the rate of inflation,which gives us $631,604.Now notice the present value that we get in this questionis exactly the same as we've gotten in partb of this question.The present values, of course, should notbe affected, whether we're dealingwith nominal or real units.If we're discounting nominal revenue or the nominal discountrate and real revenue of the real discount rate,we should be getting exactly the same answer.If we don't, it means we have made a mistake somewhere.

#### 415-1x_Rec 02_Q7, Part E-en

PROFESSOR: Now suppose that a real annual growth rate of 3%will continue over the next four years.The inflation is also expected to remainat 2.5% over the next four years.Assume that the appropriate real discount rate is 3%.What is your expected rental revenuein year 1, 2, 3, and 4 in real terms?Let us solve this question.We already found what is real revenue in year one, whichis our current revenue, $650,000 multiplied by 1plus real growth rate, which is 3%, which gives us $669,500.Now to find real revenue in a year 2,we're taking the current revenue in the year 0and multiplying it by 1 plus real growth rategr squared, because this revenue growsat this rate gr for two years.So this is $650,000 multiplied by 1plus 3% squared, which gives me $689,585.Similarly, real revenue in year 3equals current revenue multipliedby 1 plus gr raised to the power of 3,which is $650,000 multiplied by 1plus 3% raised to the power of 3, which gives us $710,272.55.Finally, extending this logic all the way to a year 4,we get current revenue in year 0 multiplied by 1plus real growth rate raised to the power of 4, which, again,equals to $650,000 multiplied by 1plus 3% raised to the power of 4, which gives me $731,580.73So altogether, these numbers give us real revenuein years 1, 2, 3, and 4.

#### 415-1x_Rec 02_Q7, Part F-en

PROFESSOR: Next, let us find the present valueof your real rental revenue over the next four years.The present value would equal to the real revenuethat you receive in each of the four years discountedto present at the real discount rate.So real revenue in year 1 dividedby 1 plus real discount rate, then real revenue in year 2discounted to present, again, at the real discount rate.So here, of course, we have to raise this to a power of 2,because this revenue occurs in year 2.So, therefore, this is the appropriate wayto find the present value of that exact real revenuethat we'll get in year 2.Then real revenue in year 3, divided by 1 plus real discountrate raised to the power of 3.And finally, the real revenue in year 4,divided again by 1 plus r--that is real discount rate, raised to power of 4.So putting this together, we get $669,500 divided by 1 plus 6%,plus $689,585 divided by 1 plus 6% squared,plus $710,272.55 divided by 1 plus 6%raised to the power of 3.And the final real revenue in year 4,which is $731,580.73, divided by 1 plus 6%,raised to power of 4.Altogether, this gives us the present value of $2,421,171.So the present value of your rental revenuethat you expect to receive over the next four yearsis $2.4 million.

PROFESSOR: In this question, we asked,what is our expected rental revenue in year 1,2, 3, and 4 in nominal terms?Recall that our current revenue in year 0 is $650,000.Then the nominal revenue in year 1equals to the current revenue multipliedby 1 plus nominal growth rate.Now recall that the nominal growth rate equals to--and can be found from the following equation.So 1 plus nominal growth rate equalsto 1 plus real growth rates multiplied by 1plus the rate of inflation.Recall that the nominal growth rate equals to 3%.And inflation in this question equals to 2.5%.So this gives me 1.05575.And from this I get the nominal growth rates of 5.575%.And now this is the nominal growth ratethat we can use to find normal revenue in years 1, 2, 3,and 4.In year one, nominal revenue wouldequal to $650,000 multiplied by 1 plus 5.575%.And this equals to $686,237.50.This number is the same as the onewe found in part C of this question above.Now continuing this logic, nominal revenue in year 2is going to be current revenue multiplied by 1plus nominal growth rate squared, again, because wereceive this revenue in year 2.And therefore, it grows for 2 years at this growth rate gn.And this equals $650,000 multiplied by 1plus 5.575% squared.This equals to $724,495.24.Nominal revenue in year 3 equals to current revenue multipliedby 1 plus nominal growth rate raised to the power 3,which again equals $650,000 multipliedby our nominal growth rate raised the power 3.And this equals to $764,885.85.So finally, nominal revenue in year 4would equal to the current revenue multipliedby 1 plus nominal growth rate raised to the power 4.And this equals to again $650,000 multiplied by 1 plus5.575% raised to the power 4 now.And this equals to $807,528.24.So these numbers together give us nominal revenuethat we expect to receive from renting out our property inyears 1, 2, 3, and 4.

#### 415-1x_Rec 02_Q7, Part H-en

PROFESSOR: The last part of this questionasks us to find the present valueof our nominal rental revenue over the next four years.Let us start this question by finding the nominal discountrate, which we will have to use to discountthe nominal rental revenue back to present.We have already done this in part D of this question.So let me remind you.1 plus nominal discount rate equals to 1plus real discount rate multiplied by 1plus the rate of inflation.Recall that the real discount rate is 6%.And the rate of inflation is 2.5%.Multiplying these two quantities gives us 1.0865.And therefore from this equation,we obtain that the nominal discount rate equals to 8.65%.Now we can find the present valueof our nominal rental revenue.Let us start by writing down what this present value shouldbe.Let me write it down in a more compact way.So it's the sum of all nominal revenue in every year,i, where i is going to go from 1 to 4,discounted to present by using the nominal discount rate.So 1 plus r nominal, raised to the power i.And so now we can expand this.And we can use the nominal revenuefor every year 1, 2, 3, and 4 that wefound in the previous part of this question.So the nominal revenue in year one is 686,237.50.We're discounting this to present at 8.65%,plus the second nominal revenue, which is $724,495.24 .We're dividing it by 1 plus our nominal discount rate8.65% raised to the power 2, again,because this revenue occurs in year 2, plus continuing.Nominal revenue in a year 3 is 764,885.85, divided by 1plus 8.65% raised to the power 3,plus the final nominal rental revenue 807,528.24 divided by 1plus 8.65% raised to the power 4.Now adding this all together gives us $2,421,171.Notice that this value equals exactly the same present valuethat we found in part F of this question.And this is the key lesson of this exerciseis that the present value, whether youare operating in nominal terms or in real terms, should equal.If it doesn't, you have made a mistake somewherealong the way.

PROFESSOR: The key input in asset valuationis the discount rate, or the rate of returnas expected by the market.It depends on the timing and risk of an asset's payoff.We will devote more time later on this relationship.For now, we would like to get a rough ideaabout the rates of return on a set of broad assetclasses traded in the market, with a range of timing and riskcharacteristics.They will give us an empirical senseon the magnitudes of discount ratesand their dependence on timing and risk.We will start with some notation and definitions.We'll use P0 to denote the price of an assetat the beginning of a period.P1 will be its price at the end of the period, whichis generally uncertain, at least at the beginning of the period.D1 gives the dividend at the end of the period, whichis also uncertain.We can then define the return or the rate of returnfrom the asset over this given period.r denotes notes the return, which isgiven by D1 plus P1 minus P0.That gives the net payoff at the endof the period, divided by P0 whichis the initial investment.The rate of return, of course, is in general uncertain giventhat D1 and P1 are uncertain.However, we can still compute the expected rateof return, which is the expected value of the realized return.We denote that by r bar.If an asset is riskless, its returnwhich we'll then note by rF, is sometimescalled the risk-free rate, which reflectsthe time value of money.There is no risk here.For a risky asset, its return net of the risk-free rateis often called the excess return.This is the return in excess of the risk-free return,and typically this reflects the compensation for the riskthat we are bearing by investing in this asset.The expected value of the excess return,which is given by r bar minus rF,is also called the risk premium on the asset,or the price of risk.It gives us the expected compensationfor bearing the risk of investing in this asset.We now consider the returns on the major asset classestraded in the US market over a fairly long period,from 1926 to 2018.It will give us a sense about the returnsand risks of these assets.Going from shorter horizon and lower riskto longer horizon and higher risk,we consider five asset classes.The first is the short-term government bonds, also calledtreasury bills.They have cash rules typically over a horizonof no more than a year, and they are fairly safe.The next asset class will be long-term government bonds,and they have payoffs over a time horizontypically more than a year, and they probablyare riskier than the short-term government bonds.The next asset class will be corporate bonds.These are bonds issued by corporations,and they are typically riskier than long-term governmentbonds.It is not shown in the figure, because itwill be too close to the plot for government bonds.Then the next asset class is large-sized stocks.These are stocks issued by large companies.And the last asset class will be small-sized stocks.These are stocks issued by small companies.In addition, we also include the inflation index,which reflects the price appreciation of real goods.Presumably assets in each one of these asset classeshave risk levels that is sort of comparable,while across different asset classesthe risk levels could be quite different.What is shown in the plot is the cumulative returnson $1 invested in any one of these asset classesat the end of 1925 to the end of 2018, over a total of 93 years.What we can look at is actually these five asset classes,starting from the ones with lower risks.We'll first start with inflation,which is given by the blue dashed lineat the bottom of the plot.For $1 invested at the end of 1925 by the end of 2018,it will be worth $14.02.The next line up, the red dashed line,is the cumulative return from $1 invested over this periodin short-term government bonds.So that $1 at the end of 1925 would have turned into $21.17.As we can see from the return of short-term government bonds,the returns are not very high, but it's very smooth.It reflects a fairly safe and low return over time.The third line is the blue line, and thatreflects the cumulative return from investingin a $1 in long-term government bonds.That $1 at the end of 1925 would have turned into $142.This is quite bit higher than whatwe would have got by investing in short-term government bonds.However, nothing is free.If we look at the cumulative return line, it is more wiggly.It can go up and down.That reflects the risk from investingin long-term government bonds.Then the next line up is the lighter red linethat reflects the cumulative return from investingin large-sized stocks.So $1 at the end of 1925 would turn into $7,030by the end of 2018.That's a lot higher than the $142we would have got by investing in long-term government bonds.Now of course, this high return is not free either.If you look at the line itself, itwiggles a lot more largely than the blue line,which is the investment in long-term government bonds.And clearly this reflects a much higher level of riskfrom stocks.Then the very top line gives the cumulative returnfrom investing in small-sized stocks.So $1 at the end of 1925 would have turned into $32,645.That's quite a bit higher than the total returnfrom investing in large stocks.From this chart, we can clearly see as we go from the bottomto the top, we are looking at asset classeswith increasing levels of risk, but also we'regetting over this period of time, a higher return.This indicates a connection, a positive connection,between the level of risk and the returnwe will get from that asset traded in a market.In this relationship is going to bethe focus of our future analysis of different assetpricing models and risk analysis.

PROFESSOR: In addition to the graph,we can also compute the average return and some measured riskfor these asset classes.In this table, we report the average returns, the risks,and risk premiums from these five asset classes.Let's first look at the second column,which gives the mean return on these five assetclasses over the 93 years that we are looking at.For the short term government bonds,the average return is 3.4%.For the long term government bond,the average return is 5.9%.Clearly, that's a little bit higherthan the average return on a short term government bonds.Then the next asset class is long term corporate bonds.On average, it yields 6.3% return.And this, again, is a little bit higher than the long termcommon bonds.Then when we move to the stocks, the large stockswill give us roughly 11.9% average returnover this period, which is quite a bit higherthan the returns we would've got from the bond assets.Therefore small stocks, the average return will be 16.2%.The last line, we post the average inflationover this period, which is 3%.So if we would take the differencebetween the nominal returns on these assetsand the average inflation over this period,we would have got the real average return on these assets.For example the real return on short term government bondswould be 3.4% minus 3% of inflation.That gives us 0.4% real return on short term government bonds.While for large stocks, the differencewould have been 11.9 minus 3%.That's 8.9%.That will be the average real return on large sized stocks.So intuitively, as we go down a list,we are actually going from safer assets, with shorter horizons,to riskier assets, with longer horizons.And indeed, as we go down the list,the average returns also increases.The next aspect we want to look atwould be the risks of these asset classes.For the short term government bonds, or the T-bills,that standard deviation of the returns on an annual basiswill be 3.1%.However, as we said, the short term government bondsare not very risky.The standard deviation here merely reflects the factthat actually interest rates are moving from year to year.So that's not really a measure of risk.It just tells us how much interest rate moves over time.Now, the next asset class will be long term government bonds.The standard deviation on their returns will be 9.8%.That's actually quite a measurable risk.The long term corporate bonds have a standard deviationof 8.4%.Surprisingly, that's a little lowerthan the standard deviation of long term government bonds.And we'll come back to talk about this seemingly unusualfeature.Then the next asset class will be large stocks.And the standard deviation on large stocks on annual baseswill be 19.8%.Clearly that's a lot higher than the standard deviationof returns, on either the government bondor the corporate bond.Therefore small stocks, the standard deviationis even higher.It would be 31.6% on annual basis.If we're using standard deviationas a simple measure of risk, clearly itlines up with our intuition.Namely, as we go down the list, the assetsare risky intuitively, and clearlythe standard deviation on returns are also increasing.The third column gives that risk premium for each of these assetclasses.It basically gives us the differencebetween the average return minus the risk-free rate.So for example, for long term government bonds,its risk premium would be 2.5%.That is given by the difference between its average return,which is 5.9 minus the risk-free rate, whichis given by the average return on a short term governmentbonds as 3.4.So that difference is 2.5.If we go down to large size stocks,the average return over the period is 11.9,and then the risk-free rate is 3.4.Take that difference, we'll get 8.5%.So 8.5% could be a rough gauge of the risk premium for stocks.What we are learning from this tablewould be some rough estimate thatwill give us some magnitudes about the discountrates for assets with different risk levels,or their risk premiums.We'll develop more sophisticated toolsto help us determine the right discount rate for a givenasset, more precisely.

PROFESSOR: We now apply the present value valuation methodto a few simple cash flows.We do so for several reasons.First, to practice the new method we have just developed.Second, the simple cash flows we will consider are quite commonin the market as well as in our daily life.Third, these simple cash flows will alsobe used to model the cash flows of various assetsas a first pass.In particular, we'll consider four special cash flows--annuity, annuity with constant growth,perpetuity, and perpetuity with constant growth.Annuity refers to a constant cash flow,say, a repeated for t periods starting from period one.And this cash flow is also shown by this cash flow chart.We're seeing a time zero for the next t periods,we're going to be getting a constant cash flow a.How do we value a cash flow like this?Assuming that we know that discount rate is r.What we would like to compute is its present valuewhich will be the first cash flow a discounted back onceat 1 plus r plus the second cash flow, whichis also a discounted at the discount rate rtwice, and so on.Now, in order to compute this, wecould either compute each of the terms, the present valueof each piece of the cash flow at the month,or we could actually try to find a simple formula.In order to do so, let's do the following.Take the first line, the present value formula.Multiply both sides by 1 plus r.That gives us the second equation,and then we take the difference between these two equations,namely subtracting the first equationfrom the second equation.That gives us the third equation,namely r times PV the present value of this annuityis given by the two terms on the right-hand side, a minus adivided by 1 plus r to the t-th power.We can rearrange the terms and arrivingat the following formula, namely the present value of annuityis just going to be given by a, the level of the cashflow, times 1 over r times what's in the square bracket.Of course, we can also compute the future value of annuitywhich is given by simply the present value of annuitytimes 1 plus r to the t-th power.That's the equation at the bottom of the slide.Let's consider an example.Suppose an insurance company is sellingan annuity, a standard product from insurance companies,that pays $10,000 per year for 20 years.Suppose that the right discount rate is 5%.The question is what should be the companysell this product for?Well, with the present value formula,we can easily finish this computation.The price for this annuity should be its present value,and that's given by this formula.The level of the annuity is $10,000.We multiply that by 1 over the discount rate 5% timeswhat's in the parentheses.If we finish this calculation, we'regoing to be getting $124,622 roughly.So that should be the price for this annuity.Of course, in reality, the insurance companymight be selling at a price that'sa little bit higher than that to pocket some profit.Next, we consider an annuity with a constant growth rate gas shown in the cash flow chart here.The first cash flow arrives in year one at a level a.Then in year two, the cash flow grows to a times 1 plus gand so on.The last cash flow occurs at year twith the level at a times 1 plus g to the t minus 1th power.The question is, what is the present value of such annuity?Well, the present value can be easycomputed by summing up the present value of eachof the cash flow.If we use the same technique as we did for annuitywith no growth, we arrive at the formulawhich is given by the second equation.And we have two different cases.In the general case where the growth rate of the cash flowdoes not equal to the discount rate r, we have the first line.In a special case where the growth rateis the same as the discount rate,then we have the second line.If we know the growing annuity starting value, its timespan, and growth rate, and its discount rate,we can easily compute its present value.We now consider an example of a growing annuity.This example resembles a saving plan for retirement.Suppose that you are now at age of 30and plan to have $2 million at age of 65 when you retire.How do you draw up a saving plan to achieve that?Suppose that at the end of each year,you will act to save certain amount that grows by 5%each year reflecting your growth in income.The question is, how much should youstart saving now assuming that the return on your savingsis 8%?We can make this calculation by thinkingin the following fashion.If you want to have $2 million in 35 years,its present value should be just $2 milliondiscounted back at 8% 35 times whichis given by the term on the right-hand sideof the equation.On the left-hand side would be the present valueof the annuity with a growth rateof 5% starting at the initial level of a.Solving for a, we'll get the following resultwhich is $6,473.That means that, actually, if youstart your savings next year at $6,473and allow that saving to grow at 5% per yearfor 35 years and the return on your savingsis 8%, then by the end of 35 years where you turn 65,the total amount in your savings accountwill be exactly $2 million as you planned.We now consider another example.Suppose you just won the lottery and it pays $100,000a year for 20 years.Suppose that actually this is the only asset you have.Are you a millionaire?Let's assume that actually the right discount rate is 10%.Well, we can compute the present valueof the stream of cash flow at a level of $100,000 for 20 years.Plug into the formula for the present value of annuity, whatwe arrive at would be $851,356.That's quite nice, but it's stillshort of a million dollars.What if the payments last for 50 years instead of 20 years?Well, we use the same formula for the first valueof annuity except that actually now the time span is 50 years.If we finished a calculation, we'll arrive at $991,481.Certainly, that's higher than the level before,but it's still shy of $1 million.How about if you're going to get $100,000 payment forever?Well, if we finished our calculation,the present value of this perpetual annuitywould be exactly $1 million.This leads us to the next special cashflow, a perpetuity.A perpetuity is like an annuity except that itdoesn't have a terminal date.The cash flow goes on forever.The present value of perpetuity at a level of ais simply given by a divide by r, the discount rateor the rate of return on your investments.If instead of staying a constant,the perpetuity also grows at a constant growth rate g,then we arrive at the perpetuity with the constant growth.It's cash flow is also shown in the cash flow chart.It starts at year one at a level a,and next year, it turns into a times 1 plus g and so onand continues forever.The present value of such a perpetuitywith the constant growth rate g isgiven by the formula on the slide, namelya divide by r, the discount rate, minus g, the growth rate.Here, it must be that the discount rate isgreater than the growth rate.Otherwise, the present value of this cash flowwould be infinity.We now consider a simple example.Let's look at a company, Super Growth,which plans to pay an annual dividend next yearof $3 per share.The dividend is expected to grow at 5% per year forever.We also know that for companies of this risk class,the expected rate of return is 10%.What should be Super Growth's share price?Well, it should be the present value of its future dividends.We can complete this computation by using the present valueformula for perpetuity with constant growth, whichis given on the right-hand side of the equation.Namely, $3 for the first dividend,divide by 10%, which is a discount rate, minus 5%, whichis the growth rate.And that gives us $60 which shouldbe the share price today.

PROFESSOR: In previous examples, we effectively assumethat cash flows and discount rates are over the same period.For convenience in the exposition,we often set the period to be one year.But in practice, this may not be the case.For example, cash flows may occurmore frequently than annually.And rates of return may be quoted or realizedmore frequently than annually.Under these circumstances, we need to treat the time periodin a consistent manner.In particular, interest or rate of return,may be credited or charged more often than annually.For example, for bank accounts and credit cards,interest is charged daily.For loans and leases, the interestis often computed on a monthly basis.For bonds the interest is paid semi-annually.For the same quoted interest rate,the effective annual rate may differ,depending on how frequent interests are received or paid.In the market interest rates are typicallyquoted in the form of annual percentage rate, or APR,with k periods of compounding within a year.What this means is that the actual interest paid per periodis APR divided by k, the number of compounding periods,and then compounded over the whole year.In this case, the actual annual ratecould be quite different from APR,depending on the number of compounding periods.In order to see the effect of compounding,let's consider the following example.Suppose that the bank quotes us in interest of 10% APR.Depending on how the interest is compounded,we'll arrive at quite different outcomes.Let's suppose that we deposit $1,000.If the compounding is annual, thenwhat we're going to be getting will be an interestof 10% on the principle.That is $100 at the end of the year, and that would be $1,100.And that's given by the second column in the table.But what if the compound is semiannual?In that case, the interest would behalf of the 10% APR paid over every 6 months.The outcome is given by the third column.We start with a balance of $1,000.In 6 months that turned into $1,050.That's $1,000 plus 5% of 6 months' interest.And therefore the next 6 months, we'regoing to be getting another 5% of intereston the starting balance of $1,050.So by the end of the year, we'll be getting $1,103.Clearly, that's different from the previous casewhen the 10% APR is compounded annually.The fourth column gives the situationwhen the 10% APR is compounded quarterly.Here for every quarter, we're getting 2 and 1/2%of the interest.But that accumulates over three quarters.The last column gives the outcomeif the interest is compounded monthly.And by the end of the year, the $1,000of principal at the beginning of year would turn into $1,105.As we can see, as the compounding periods increase,we're actually going to be gaining more outcome.And the reason is that when interestsare paid more frequently, we're earning intereston the interest payments paid previously.Let's now look at another examplein slightly more detail.Suppose that actually Bank of Americaoffers one-year certificates of depositsat an APR of 5% with semi-annual compounding.If you invest $10,000, how much moneydo you have at the end of one year?What is the actual interest rate that you earn?Well first, we already know the quoted APR of 5%is not the actual annual rate, because the compounding is notannual.It's only used to compute the 6-month interest rate, whichwill be half of the 5%.That's 2 and 1/2%.If we invest $10,000 at the beginning of a year,then by the year end what we would havewould be $10,000 times 1 plus 2 and 1/2%.That's for 6 months' interest, then times 1 plus 2 and 1/2%again for the second 6-month period.In total, the end balance would be $10,506.25.In the second 6-month period you earn intereston the interest paid for the first 6 months.So the actual annual rate, which is alsocalled the effective annual rate, or EAR,is given by this last equation on a slide.The effective annual rate equals to 1 plus 2 and 1/2%compounded twice, because we have two compounding periodswithin a year, then minus 1.That gives 5.0625%.That is the actual annual interestrate we're earning on this CD.More generally, we can compute the effective annual ratefrom the APR plus the number of compounding periods.Let our APR be the APR, and k the number of compoundingintervals per year.Then in one year, $1 invested todaywould yield 1 plus the APR divided by k.That's the actual interest rate paid for each period.And then compound it k times.The effective annual rate is thengiven by the following equation, namely 1plus the effective annual rate shouldequal to 1 plus the interest per compounding period,then compound it 10 times.And this gives us the equation on the bottom rightof the slide.The effective annual rate is basically the gross returnover the year, minus 1.We can further see the relationshipbetween the effective annual rateand the number of compounding periods,holding constant the APR.Suppose that the APR is 5%.Then the effective annual rate we'regoing to be getting as described in the table below,depends on the number of compounding periods.If k is 1, then that means that the compoundingis on an annual basis.Then the effective annual rate is just 5%, same as the APR.If k equals 2, that is if the compounding is semi-annual,then the effective annual rate will be 5.0625%.That's higher than the 5% we are gettingif the compounding is annual.If compounding is on a monthly basis, namely k equals 12,then we get the third row, the effective annual ratewill be 5.1162%.What if k equals 365?That means that the compounding is on a daily basis.Then the effective annual rate will be 5.1267%.How about on an hourly basis?That is when k equals 8,760.Nobody really does that, but hereis just as an illustration.Then the effective annual rate will be 5.1271.What if the compounding is continuous?Then what we're getting as the effective annual rate willbe 5.1271.And that's fairly close to the hourly compounding result.Of course nobody really does continuous compounding.But as we'll see later on, for mathematical convenience,sometimes we assume the compoundingis continues to arrive at some simple results.

PROFESSOR: Before we finish our discussion on special cashflows in compounding, we would liketo look at one more example, mortgage calculation.Here, we are going to be looking at a fixed rate mortgage that'stypical in the United States.It often requires a 20% down paymentand borrow the rest from a bank using the propertyas collateral.Over time of the mortgage, the borrowerwould pay a fixed monthly paymentand, typically, the borrower also has the option to prepay.Namely, during the time of the mortgage if the interestrate moves in the desirable direction,the borrower can actually borrow more moneyfrom the market at a lower rate and then repaythe previous mortgage.Now let's consider a specific example.Suppose that you're buying a house for $500,000, halfa million dollars, with 20% down payment, that is $100,000.And then finance the remaining partwhich is $400,000 using a 30 year fixed rate mortgage.Let's assume that the mortgage rateis 8.5% APR compounded monthly because the mortgagepayments are typically on a monthly basis.The question we would like to answeris, what would be the monthly payment for this mortgage?Well, the monthly payment for this mortgageis really like annuity with 360 payments,monthly payments, at some level, let's say, M. Now for this dealto be fair, the present value of all these monthly mortgagepayments should equal to the amount of moneywe are borrowing, namely $400,000.So if you write down this equation,on the left-hand side is the amount we are borrowing,on the right-hand side is the present valueof all the future mortgage payments we have to pay,total 360 of them on a monthly basis.If the monthly payment is M, we can look at each one of them,discount them back using the mortgage interest rate.Keep in mind that the mortgage interest rate 8.5is an APR with monthly compounding.So the actual monthly interest is 8.5% divide by 12.So if we use the present value formulafor annuity, what we're going to be gettingwill be the right-hand side of the second equation.What's unknown here is the monthly payment M.If we solve for that, we're goingto be adding arriving at the following result.The monthly payment would be $3,075.65.What is that effective annual interest ratewe're paying on this mortgage?That is not 8.5%, the APR, because that APR iscompounded on a monthly basis.Using our EAR formula, we can easilycompute the effective annual ratefor this mortgage, which is givenby the last equation on the slide, thatis 8.839% rather than 8.5%.So this computation is really what's behind mortgage loans.What we have shown is that for a mortgageof $400,000 at a mortgage rate of 8.5%APR with monthly compounding, the actual monthly paymentis $3,075.65.And that's shown in the second columnof the table on the slide.And of course, given that this is a 30-year mortgage payment,the monthly payments will continuefor 30 years with a total of 360 monthly payments.What we can also show is that the monthly paymentof $3,075.65 consists of two pieces.One part is the interest on the remaining principal,the other part is the amount that we'repaying down the principal.So the interest payments, over the life span of the mortgage,is given by the third column in a table shown in red.So for the first month, the interest payment is $2,833.33.That's, that is a bigger chunk of the monthly payment.Only $242.37 is used from the monthly paymentto pay down the principal.After the first month of mortgage payment,the remaining principal is given by the last column.The first row gives us $399,757.68.Then for the second month, the interest paymentwould be 8.5% divide by 12, that'sthe monthly interest times, the remaining principal that's$399,757.68.That will give us the second row in the third column.That's the interest payment of $2,831.62.The difference between that and the monthly payment,which is $244.04, that's the second rowin the fourth column, that is the amountfrom the second monthly payment that goes into paying downthe principal.And after the second monthly mortgage payment,the remaining principal is given by the second rowof the last column, $399,513.64.And we can keep going through this calculationall the way to the last month of the mortgage.So for the last month's mortgage,which is given by the last row in the table,the total monthly payment is still $3,075.65.Out of that only $21.63 is paying the intereston the remaining principal.$3,054.02 goes to paying down the remaining principal.Of course, by that time, the remaining principalwill be paid down to zero and the mortgage is completed.We can also show this through this graph.What's shown here is the percentageof the monthly mortgage payment, namely $3,075 or so.What percentage goes to the interest paymentand what percentage goes into paying down the principal?The red gives us the fraction of the mortgage paymentthat's paying the interest.And the blue shows the percentageof the monthly mortgage payment that's usedto paying down the principalOver the lifespan of the mortgage,as we can see the fraction of interest paymentactually at the beginning, takes most partof the monthly payment, but over time, actuallydecreases, eventually hits zero.For the percentage of monthly paymentpaying down the principal, it's just the opposite.At the beginning, only a small fraction of the monthly paymentgoes into paying down the principal.But over time, it increases.By the end of the mortgage lifespan, it's almost 100%of the monthly payment.

PROFESSOR: We have now developed a general methodto value an asset.If we are given its expected cashflow and the right discount rate,its value is simply given by the present valueof its expected cash flow, a simple calculation.When using this method in different applications,we need to come up with estimatesof an asset's expected cash flow and the corresponding discountrates.As we dive into these applications,we will further develop the tools and techniquesneeded to come up with these estimates.For now, I would only like to mentionseveral general considerations to keepin mind in actual valuation applications.The first is taxes.It is important to keep in mind that cash flows generatedby assets are often subject to taxes.For example, financial assets, such as bonds and stocks,pay in the form of interest, dividends, and capital gains.Investors may have to pay taxes on these payments.Firms earn profits, but they also have to pay taxes.What then matters when it comes to valuing an assetwill be its cash flows after taxes.Thus, in the present value calculation,we have to use after tax cash flows.We will see more of this point in later applications,especially in project valuations.The second factor to keep in mind is currency.All examples so far, and throughout this course,will consider cash flows denominated in US dollars.This is only for convenience.In practice, of course, cash flowscan come in other currencies.Our method is perfectly applicable.We only need to switch to cash flows and discountrates denominated in these currencies.The third factor to keep in mind is how to forecast cash flows.When valuing an asset, we first needto come up with estimates or forecasts of its future cashflows--magnitude, timing and risk.Sometimes these forecasts are givento us, such as the cash flow of a government bond, whichincludes interests and the principal payment.Often we need to come up with our own forecasts,such as dividends from a stock or profits from a project.We will do so when we get into these applications.Given an asset's cash flow, size, timing and risk,we need to find the right discount rates from the market.How to do this operationally requires further developmentand enrichment of our valuation methodology,which we will spend more time on over this course.For now, we only need to keep in mind a few points.For cash flow, the discount rate will depend on its timing.That is, if it's in one year, in two years, or five years.In case the cash flow is risk-free,we can use the risk-free interest ratewhich reflects the time value of money as determinedin the financial market.However, it is important to know that one year interest rate isin general different from two year and five year interestrates.In general, cash flows are risky.In this case, we need to include the proper risk adjustmentin the discount rate--namely, the risk premium associatedwith the risk of the cash flow.It is also important to keep in mindthat the risk for net asset's one year cash flowcan be quite different from the risk in its two year cash flow.Consequently, the risk premium for each of these cash flowsare, in general, different.Putting the pieces together, we havethe following present value formula,where present value is the sum of the present valuesof each piece of the asset's cash flow.That is, the expected cash flow at each time, t,discounted at rt, the appropriate discount ratefor that cash flow C FT.Despite the fact that the discount rate for each cashflow of an asset is in general different,in most of our examples, we will use the same discountrate for an asset's cash flow at different points in time.It is important to keep in mind that this is mostlyfor simplicity.

PROFESSOR: This question teaches youhow to find a present value of an annuity.Suppose that you have an outstanding loan that requiresten annual payments of $2,300.Now is Year 0, and the next payment on the loanis due next year.The last payment is due in Year 10.There is a bank account that offers 5% annual interest rate.You would like to make a deposit into this account today, whichwould allow you to repay this loan.The first part of this question asksyou to find the amount that you need to deposit.The second question asks you to demonstratethat the amount you deposited is indeedenough to repay this loan.Let's start with the first question.The money you need to deposit is the present valueof these payments discounted at 5%.To find the present value, we can use the annuity formula.Present value would equal to $2,300, whichis our annual payment, divided by 5%, multiplied by 1 minus 1divided by 1 plus 5%, raised to the power of 10because we have 10 payments.This would equal to $17,760.Let me demonstrate that if we discountannual payments by hand, we will get the same answer.Let me start with the first paymentand find its present value.I will take the payment itself, and I will divide itby 1 plus discount rate.Raise to the power of 1 because this paymentoccurs one year from now.If I extend this array all the way to Year 10,this will give me the present value of eachof these individual payments.For example, the very last cell gives methe present value of the last payment, $2,300,discounted to the present.We are raising it to power of 10 because this payment occursin Year 10.To find the total value of these payments in present valueterms, we will just add them up.This gives us exactly $17,760, the same value that we obtainedby using the annuity formula.Let's answer the second part of this questionby demonstrating that depositing $17,760is enough to fully repay this loan.We're beginning Year 1 with this much money in our bank account.During this first year, the bank pays us 5% interest rateon this amount.So the interest that we earned wouldequal to the beginning balance multipliedby the interest rate of 5%.At the end of Year 1, we are making our annual payment.And therefore, the end balance wouldequal to the beginning balance plus the interestthat you earned minus the payment that we made.Then, we're starting second year by having this much moneyin our bank account.During this year, we're still earning 5% intereston this balance.And we're making the same payments.And we're ending this year with the balancein our account of $14,865.Now, let's see what happens if we extend thesearrays all the way to Year 10.We will see that we will start Year 10 by having$2,190 in our bank account.During this year, we're earning 5% interest on this beginningbalance, which is exactly enough to pay$2,300 at the end of this year, which leaves uswith the balance of exactly $0.We just demonstrated that depositing $17,760 nowinto a bank account that pays the annual interest rate of 5%is enough to repay this loan.Overall, what we learned in this questionis how to find a present value of a stream of cash flowsthat represents an annuity.

PROFESSOR: Suppose that you have an outstanding loan thatrequires ten annual payments of $2,300.Now is Year Zero, and the next payment on the loanis due in Year 6.The last payment is due in Year 15.There is a bank account that offers 5% annual interest rate.You would like to make a deposit into this account today, whichwould allow you to repay this loan.What is the amount that you need to deposit?This question is similar to question 1because we have the same annual payment, the same interestrate.The only difference is that our payments start in Year 6and end in Year 15.So let's first find the present value of these paymentsby using brute-force.So I'll start discounting each of these individual payments,similar to what we did in question 1,by taking the payment and dividing itby 1 plus the discount rate.And I will raise it to the power,which equals to the year in which this payment occurs.We'll extend this array.This would give me the present value of eachof these individual payments.And I will add them up.And this will give me the present valueof all of these payments, which would equal to $13,915.42.Now, let's do something smarter.First, I will relabel the timelinebut ignoring the first year in which we receive paymentby Year 1.In this case, Year 6 in the actual timeline,is Year 1 in the new timeline.In this new timeline, the stream of paymentslooks like a regular annuity, and wecan find its present value.In fact, we already found it in question 1.It equals to $17,760.But in the old timeline, this is the valuein Year 5, not present value.To find its present value, what we need to do,we need to discount it by dividing itby 1 plus our interest rate, 5%, raised to the power of 5.By doing so, we get $13,915.42.This is exactly the same answer as weobtained by discounting each payment manually.The stream of cash flows we started in this questionrepresents a delayed annuity.Now, let's summarize what we learned in this question.If we need to find a present value of a delayed annuity thatstarts paying in Year N, we need to do the following.First, we use the annuity formula to find its valuein Year N minus 1.And second, we discount Year N minus 1 value to present.

PROFESSOR: In this question, we willlearn how to find present value of growing annuity.Now is Year 0.A biotechnology company has developeda new nanorobotic surgical device.The patent on the device will last 15 years.You expect that the profit from the device will be $5 millionin Year 1.From Year 1 until Year 15, annual profitis expected to grow at a rate of 4% per year.After patent expires, the emergence of new devicesand competition with other biotech firmswill drive profits from this surgical device to zero.The question asks us, what is the present valueof the new device if the discount rate is 9% per year?Let's first use brute-force to findthe present value of profits generated by this device.As the question states, in Year 1,this device generates $5 million in profits.From that point onwards, these profits grow at a 4% rate.So in a Year 2, the profit generated by this devicewill be $5 million multiplied by 1 plus the growth rate of 4%.And this growth will continue all the way to Year 15.So in Year 15, the device generates$8,658,382 in profits.Now, what I will do in the next column,I will discount each of these cash flowsindividually to present.So the present value of the first cash flowwill be $5 million divided by 1 plus the discount rate of 9%,raised to the power 1.This is the year when this cash flow occurs.And we'll continue doing so all the way to Year 15.For example, in Year 15 the present valueof the profit that occurs in Year 15would be this value divided by 1 plus discount rate of 9%,raised to the power of 15.Now what's left is to add them up.So the sum of these discount valueswould represent the total present valueof all profits generated by this nanorobotic device.Now let's do something smarter.Notice that the stream of cash flowsthat we have in this question represents a growing annuity.Each payment growth has a growth rate of g equals to 4%.The discount rate is 9%.And the number of periods over which will get cash flowis 15 years.So therefore, to find the present valueof the stream of cash flows, we canuse growing annuity formula.So the present value of this growing annuitywould be the first payment, which is $5 million,divided by discount rate, 9%, minus growth rate,4%, multiplied by 1 minus 1 plus g,which is 4%, raised to the power of 15--this is the total number of periods over which we'llreceive the cash flow--divided by 1 plus discount rate, 9%,raised again to the power 15.So this value, if we compute it, will equal to $50,557,250exactly the same value that we obtainedby applying the brute-force.Overall, it is much more efficient to findthe present value of this stream of cash flowsby using the growing annuity formulainstead of discounting each of the individual cash flowsby hand.And therefore, this should be our preferred approachgoing forward.

PROFESSOR: In this question, we willlearn how to work with regular and delayed perpetuity.Suppose that you are chief financial officerof a company that owns a commercial real estateproperty that is currently unused and is unoccupied.Assuming that the appropriate discount rate is 7%,you would like to estimate the value of this propertyunder the following two assumptions.A, you can start renting it out immediately.You expect the annual rental profit to be $650,000and to continue in perpetuity.The first payment will occur in year one.B, you will spend the first four yearsredeveloping this property.The present value of redevelopment costsis $1 million.Starting in year five, you will receive annual rental profitof $950,000 which will continue in perpetuity.What is the value of the property under scenarios Aand B?Let's start our analysis by looking at scenario A.If we rent out our property immediately,we will receive $650,000 in year one.This profit will continue being generated every yearin perpetuity.So therefore, this stream of cash flowsrepresents a regular perpetuity.The first payment starts in year one and it continues forever.Therefore, we can find the present valueof this perpetual stream of cash flowsby taking the first payment that we receive of $650,000and just dividing it by the discount rate, in our case,it is 7%.So the present value of this rental profit is $9,285,714.So therefore, this property will generate exactly that muchthroughout its perpetual lifetime.Now, let's turn to the analysis of scenarioB. In this scenario, we develop the propertyduring the first four years.It starts generating a profit of $950,000 in year five,and this profit will be generated every year thereafterforever.We call this stream of cash flows a delayed perpetuity.It is similar to regular perpetuitywith the only difference that the first cash flow starts notin year one, but later.In our case, it starts in year five.To find the present value of the delayed perpetuity,let's follow an approach we developed in question two.Let's draw a timeline, a new timeline,by denoting the first year in which we receive paymentby year one.In this case, year five in the actual timelineis year one in the new timeline.In this new timeline, the stream of paymentslooks like a regular perpetuity.And we can find its present value.It equals to $950,000 divided by 7% which is $13,571,429.Importantly, note that in the actual timeline,this value is in the year four, not in year zero.To find its present value, we need to discount it furtherby dividing it by one plus 7% raise to the power of four.Therefore, the present value of this delayed perpetuityis $10,353,578.Overall, what we've found so far is that this propertygenerates $10,353,578.Taking into account the present value of redevelopment costs,which are $1 million, the value of the propertyunder this scenario is $9,353,578.Recall that if we choose scenario A,the present value of the propertyis $9,285,714 which is less than what we got under scenario B.The conclusion is that we should redevelopthis property because this would generate higherwealth as indicated by the larger present value.

PROFESSOR: Jeff Bezos recently made an announcementthat he would donate $10 billion to combat climate change.Suppose that he plans to establisha foundation to which he will pledge the entire amount of $10billion.Every year his foundation will distribute fundsto organizations that fight climate change.Let's assume that the foundation will invest fundsinto financial assets that will on average generatenominal annual rate of return of 8%.Now the first question is asking usif Bezos' foundation wants to be able to distribute fundsin perpetuity and if they plan to distribute the same dollaramount each year, what will be the annual distribution amount?Now we will assume that the first distribution happensin exactly one year from now.Notice that the distribution stream from the foundationrepresents perpetuity.Suppose that the annual distribution equalsto C dollars, then the present value of the stream of paymentscan be written as present value equals to C divided by 1plus r, plus C divided by 1 plus r squared, plus C divided by 1plus r cubed, and so forth.Remember this is a perpetuity, so this is an infinite streamof cash flow.We have learned in the lecture that the present valueof such perpetuity equals to C divided by r.Now the question gives us the present valueof this perpetuity.This is the amount of money that Jeff Bezospledged to the foundation, which is $10 billion.Now given the interest rate of 8%we can solve this equation for the annual paymentamount, which would be C equals present valuemultiplied by interest rate r or in this case $10 billionmultiplied by 8%, which would be equal to $800 million.

#### 415-1x_Rec 03_Q5, Part B-en

PROFESSOR: Let's start by assumingthat the annual distribution amount equalsto c, similar to what we did in part a of this question.Then we can write down the present valueof this stream of distributions from Jeff Bezos' foundation.It's going to equal to c-- this is the current distribution--plus c divided by 1 plus r-- this is the present valueof the second distribution, which will happen one year fromtoday--plus c divided by 1 plus r squared--this is the present value of the third distribution, which willhappen two years from now--plus c divided by 1 plus r raised to the power of 3,which is the present value of the fourth distribution, whichwill happen three years from now, and so forth.Now, we need to find the present value of this amounton the right hand side of this equation.To do this, notice that this part of the equationis just the regular perpetuity.And we already know the present valueof the regular perpetuity.Therefore, we can write down this equation as such.So the present value of this stream of cash flowsequals to c plus c divided by r.Now, we know that the present valueof the pledged amount to the foundation is $10 billion.Given that the interest rate is 8%,we can solve this equation for the annual payment amount.So the annual payment amount c wouldequal to the present value dividedby 1 plus 1 divided by r.Plugging in the numbers, $10 billion and 8% interest rate,would get $740,740,740.Therefore, the annual distribution amountwill be around $741 million.Note that if Jeff Bezos starts distributing fundsin one year from now, the annual perpetual distribution amountwill be $800 million.If on the other hand, he starts distributing money immediately,this lowers the annual perpetual distribution amountto $741 million.This does make economic sense due to the factthat the immediate distribution lowers the balance of fundson the foundation's balance sheet,and therefore lowers its ability to earn 8% annual interestrate on this amount.

PROFESSOR: Now, suppose that the expected future annual rateof inflation is 2%.If Jeff Bezos wants to distributean equal annual amount in today's dollarsto guarantee purchasing power of distributed funds,how much would the annual distribution amount be?Assume that the first distributionhappens one year from now.Suppose that the annual distribution from the fundequals c dollars.Let's denote by i the annual rate of inflation.Future distributions from the fundneed to grow at the same rate as the inflationto guarantee their purchasing power.In year one, for example, distributionshould equal to c times 1 plus i.More generally, in the year t, distribution amount would equalc times 1 plus i raised to the power of t.For example, in the year two, distribution amountwould be c times 1 plus i raised to the power of 2.Let's put these distributions on the timeline.For comparison, let's also draw a streamof payments that represent a regular growing perpetuity.Notice that the two streams look alike with one difference.For regular perpetuity, the first payment in year oneis c and the second payment in year two is c times 1plus g, where g is the growth rate.In our case, however, the first paymentis c times 1 plus i and the second paymentis c times 1 plus i squared.Now, mathematically, we can make our stream of paymentslook like a regular perpetuity if wefactor 1 plus the rate of inflation term out.To see this, let's write down the present valueof our stream, which is present valueequals to c times 1 plus i dividedby 1 plus r plus c multiplied by 1 plus i squared divided by 1plus r squared and so forth.Factoring 1 plus i out gives us the following expression--present value equals to 1 plus i multipliedby c divided by 1 plus r plus c multiplied by 1plus i divided by 1 plus r squared, and so forth.The expression inside large bracketslooks just like a regular perpetuity.Hence, its present value is just c divided by r minus i.And therefore, the present value of our streamis 1 plus i multiplied by c divided by r minus i.All that's left here is to find c in this expression.Remember that we are given the present value, whichis the amount that Jeff Bezos pledgedto the foundation, which is $10 billion.Given the interest rate of 8%, wecan solve this equation for payment amount c.$10 equals to 1 plus 2%, which is the rate of inflation,multiplied by c divided by 8%, whichis our interest rate, minus 2%, which is the rate of inflation.Rearranging, this gives us c equals to $10 times8% minus 2% divided by 1 plus 2%.This equals to $588,235,294 or roughly $588.2 million.Note that the value of $588 millionthat we found in this question is significantly lowerthan the cost and distribution valuethat we found in part a which was $800 million.Intuitively, since we have to adjust for inflation,we have to start paying a lower amountso that we have enough funds to guaranteeall the future payments and adjustments for inflation.

PROFESSOR: In this question, we willlearn how to work with effective annual ratesand with annual percentage rates.Let's start with Part A of this question.A credit card company charges you 20% annual percentagerate or APR compounded monthly.What is the Effective Annual Rate or EARthat you are being charged?To find the effective annual rate,we use the formula we developed in the lecture.EAR equals to 1 plus APR divided by k,and raised to the power k, minus 1,where k is the number of compounding intervalsin a year.In our case APR equals to 20% and k equals to 12because the credit card company compounds interest monthlyand there are 12 months in a year.This gives us EAR of 21.94%.Overall this result indicates that the bank effectivelycharges us 21.94% which is substantially higher comparedto the APR of 20%.Let's continue with Part B of this question.Suppose that you work for a credit card companyand you would like to earn an effective annual rate of 25%on your credit card loans.You are free to choose a compounding intervalwith the only constraint that the shortestperiod has to be one day.Assuming that you want to present the lowestAPR to your customers, what is the optimal frequencyof compounding?What is the APR at the optimal compounding frequency?As we have seen in the lecture, for a given APR,the higher the frequency of compounding, the higheris the effective annual rate.Our goal in this question is to find the optimal compoundingfrequency for a given EAR that would result in the lowest APR.Intuitively, for a fixed EAR, we should compound interestas frequently as possible because the higher compoundingfrequency will lead to lower APR.In our case, the optimal frequency of compoundingshould be daily.Let's do the following.First, we will compute APR assuming daily compounding.Then we will compute APR assuming quarterly compounding.And then we will generalize this result.Let's start with daily compounding.Assume that there are 365 days in a year.For a given effective annual rate of 25%, let's find APR.Let's start with the basic relationshipbetween EAR and APR.1 plus effective annual rate equalsto 1 plus APR divided by k which is the compounding frequencyraised to the power of k.We can rearrange this equation to find APRas a function of EAR.APR would equal to k, the compounding frequencymultiplied by 1 plus EAR raised to the power of 1over k minus 1.For an effective annual rate of 25%in daily compounded interest, APR in this casewould be 22.3%.Now let's compute APR if interest is compoundedquarterly instead of daily.In this case, compounding frequency kwould equal to 4, which would give us an APR of 22.9%.Therefore, if we choose quarterly compounding,the APR of 22.9% would give us effective annual rate of 25%.But if we choose daily compounding the APR of 22.3%would still give us the effective annual rate of 25%.So given that we want to earn effective annual rate of 25%and we want to display the lowestAPR to our customer as possible, weshould choose daily compounding.This would allow us to advertise APR of 22.3%.Let's generalize this result.Here, I have created an array thatdenotes the frequency of compounding from 1 all the wayto 365.One corresponds to annual compounding and 365corresponds to daily compounding.Now for each of these intervals, I will compute APR.We see that for quarterly compoundingAPR equals to 22.9% which matchesthe number we found before.For annual compounding when k equals to 1,APR is 25% which intuitively should be correctbecause when interest is compounded annuallyAPR should equal to EAR.Now the plot to the right shows APRas a function of compounding interval for a giveneffective annual rate of 25%.This is a decreasing function whichindicates that highest compounding frequencycorresponds to lowest APR.Recall that for daily compounding interest,APR equals to 22.3%.Overall, this illustrates that our decisionto go with daily compounding is the right one.

PROFESSOR: Let's start solving this questionby first computing monthly interest rateson the old and the new loan.Recall that, on the old loan, we'repaying 6.5% effective annual rate.To find the monthly rate, let's startwith the following equation.So 1 plus effective annual rate would equal to 1plus monthly rate raised to the power of 12.From this equation, we can find monthly rateby just inverting it.So it's going to be, 1 plus effective annual rateraised to the power of 1 over 12 minus 1.So it's going to be 1 plus 6% raised to the power of 1over 12 minus 1.And this would give me 0.487%.So this is the monthly rate that we're paying on the old loan.To find the monthly interest rate on the new loan,note that the new loan is quoted to us as annual percentage ratemonthly component.So therefore, for us to find the monthly rate, all we have to dois, we're taking this monthly component APRand we're dividing it by 12, which is 4.5% divided by 12.This would be 0.375%.So this is the interest--monthly interest on the new loan, and up herewas the monthly interest rate that we'repaying on the old loan.So you can already see that we got a betterdeal on the new loan.So therefore, refinancing the old mortgagewith the new mortgage would lower our monthly payments.Now, let's find monthly payments on the old and the new loanand compare them.First, let's start with the old loan.So the current value, the present valueof the mortgage that we have is $300,000.So this must equal to the monthly paymentthat we're making--and I will denoted it as c o--as the monthly payment on the old mortgage, divided by r m.So this would be the rate--the monthly rate on the old mortgagemultiplied by 1 minus 1 divided by 1 plus rm raised to the power 240.240 because we have 20 years lefton the life of this mortgage.And so for us to find our monthly payment, allwe have to do, we have to invert this equation.So it's going to be $300,000 and thenwe'll divide it by 1 divided by r m, 1 minus 1divided by 1 plus r m, raised to the power of 240.If we solve this equation by plugging in the interestrate of 0.487%, the monthly interest rate,we will get c o, which is the, again, monthly paymenton the old mortgage of $2,121.88.Now, let's do the same for the new loan.So I can write down the same equation.So it's the same if we were to refinance.Right now, we need to still raisethe present value of $300,000 so that the proceedsfrom the new loan can be used to repay the old loan.And that again would be equal to our monthly payments.And I will denote it as c n, to denotethe new payment, the new loan, divided by r m 1 minus 1plus r m also raised to the power of 240.So now this r m is the interest rate on the new loan.And I can find c n, similarly, by justinverting this equation.So c n is going to equal to $300,000 dividedby 1 divided by r m, 1 minus 1 plus 1 r mraised to the power of 240.And so if we compute-- if we plug-inr m that equals to 0.375%, we're goingto get monthly payment on this loan of $1,897.95.Now we can see that by refinancing the old loanwith the new loan, we're saving the differencebetween these two amounts.What we used to pay on the old loan and our newlower monthly payments.The difference is about $223.93.So this is by how much we're lowering our monthly paymenton the mortgage.

#### 415-1x_Rec 03_Q7, Part B-en

PROFESSOR: Now, let's do cash out refinance.So instead of lowering our monthly mortgage payments,we will continue paying the same amount as we paid before.But because this new mortgage is cheaper,we will be able to borrow a larger amount from a bankand pay the existing loan and use the remainingcash for other purposes, such as, as the question states,buying a new car or doing something else.So the question is, given this new cheaper rate, how much wecan borrow if we were to continue paying the same amountthat we paid before on our old mortgage.So the answer is simply this.So this question is asking us to find the present valueof our old payment.Recall that our old payment was $2,121.88.At the new monthly rate, which was 0.375%.So 0.375%.I'm just using the annuity formulato find the present value of this amount.1 minus 1 divided by 1 plus this interest rateraised to the power of 240.Recall that this is a 20 year loan on which weare paying monthly payments, so there are 240 months.And by computing this amount--this is the present value of how much we will be able to borrow.This gives me $335,395.29.We will take this new loan from the bankand pay $300,000 on our existing mortgage to the other bank,therefore leaving ourselves with $35,395.29.

PROFESSOR: In this class, we will talkabout fixed income securities--the properties, the markets where they trade,and some of the important elementsof analytics of dealing with fixed income assets, howwe price them.Let's begin with a general overview of fixed incomemarkets and securities.A fixed income security is a financial claimwith promised cash flows of fixed amount and fixed dates.When we use the term fixed income, this refers to the factthat these securities are explicit about which cashflows are promised and when.This does not mean that they are risk free.Obviously, there could be circumstanceswhen these securities do not deliver the promised cashflows.There are various types of fixed income securities tradedin the markets, and these form an important partof capital markets.We are going to mention just several of the major classesof fixed income securities.At the top of our list are treasuries.These are government bonds issuedby various governments, US treasuries, Japanese governmentbonds, German bonds.These are used by governments to conduct their fiscal policy.In the United States, we also havedebt of fixed income assets issued by the federal sponsoredagencies, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.And these are the agencies that supportthe functions of the housing market,and they are important players in the fixed income markets.Municipal bonds are a little bit different from treasuriesbecause of their tax treatment.Municipal bonds in the United Statesare exempt from the federal tax.And for the local investors, theyare also exempt from the local state taxes.Corporate bonds are also an important and large partof the fixed income market.They come in various forms and shapes.They differ across maturities and various propertiesof securities that we are going to discuss a little bit later.Corporate bonds are issued by firmsand are used to finance a variety of business activities.Finally, we should mention mortgage-backed andasset-backed securities, which are createdusing financial engineering using the process calledsecuritization.And these assets are based on an underlying pool of other moreprimitive assets, such as mortgages, car loans, studentloans, and so forth.The following pie chart gives us a snapshot of the bond marketsin the United States in 2019.As you can see here, there are three large segmentsof the market that capture most of the market valueacross fixed income securities.First, the treasuries.Treasuries account for roughly a thirdof the fixed income market.These are bonds issued by the US government.Second, mortgage-related securities.These are at a lower level than the treasury market,but they capture roughly a quarterof the fixed income market.These are securities that are backed by pools of mortgages.We also see that the corporate debt market is roughlyof the same size as the mortgage-related securitiesand accounts for roughly a quarterof the fixed income market.We have several smaller segments,such as debt securities issued by federal agencies--Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac.These are at roughly 4% of the total market.Asset-backed securities-- these aresecurities that are backed by poolsof financial assets other than mortgages-- car loans, studentloans.These are at around 4% of the total market.And the municipal market is about 8% of the total.And finally, the money markets, whichare very short maturity securities, thatstands at around 2% of the total market.What we can see from this graph is that fixed income marketsare fairly heterogeneous.There are several large segments.And in our discussion, we are goingto focus on some of these in particular.In today's lecture, our primary focusis going to be on the valuation of treasuries.And in the following classes, we'regoing to talk about pricing of corporate bonds.Next, let's consider participantsin the fixed income markets.It is convenient to think in termsof three broad categories--the issuers, the intermediaries, and the investors.This division is not exact, and someof the players in these markets play multiple rolesand show up in different categories.Issuers in these markets are those entities thatissue fixed income securities.These are the borrowers in fixed income markets.Governments are important playersin fixed income markets.They issue treasuries, government bonds.Municipalities are the source of municipal securitiesand corporations, who issue corporate bonds.There are various intermediaries present in these markets thatfacilitate primary transactions, which is when a borrower issuesthe bond for the first time, as well as secondary markettransactions.This is when the bonds change handsand are traded among investors.We are going to highlight only a fewof the intermediaries that are important.We have various kinds of dealers in these markets.We have primary dealers and other dealers.Primary dealers play a special role in the sensethat they participate in the auctions of governmentsecurities.So they are the first ones to absorbthe supply of government bonds.Other dealers facilitate transactionsin the secondary market among investors.For example, a treasury starts its lifeby being issued by the US government.It gets sold to a primary dealer,which could be a large bank.And then it eventually gets sold in the secondary marketto other investors.A bond can, of course, change hands multiple timesthroughout its life by being traded in the secondary market.Investment banks play an important roleas intermediaries in the fixed income markets.They serve multiple functions.They can act as a dealer holding an inventory of bonds.They can act as a broker making matchesbetween buyers and sellers of fixed income securities.And they can also help corporations or municipalitiesissue their bonds.So they can help in the primary transactions.They can help structure bonds and place them with investors.An important class of players in fixed income marketsare credit rating agencies.This is a somewhat unique feature.We do not see this kind of entity in the equity markets.They are specific to the fixed income markets.As the name suggests, credit rating agencies,such as S&P or Moody's, serve to provide informationabout the quality of fixed income securities.They rate credit quality.They attach credit rating to different securitiesthat indicates the relative riskiness.This information can be then used by the investorsto decide on how to allocate their capitalacross different types of assets.We're going to look more closely at ratings of bondsand how they map into their risk whenwe discuss risky corporate bonds in the following classes.There are multiple types of investors in the fixed incomemarkets.Pension funds, insurance companiesare big holders of bonds.In particular, insurance companieshold large quantities of corporate bondsand pension funds also hold a significant amountof treasuries and corporate bonds of various maturities.Mutual funds hold portfolios of fixed income securities,and they can be viewed as one example of an entity whichis both an investor and an intermediary in this market.If you think about the mutual fundas a holder of corporate bonds, then of courseit acts as an investor.At the same time, mutual funds serve an important functionof enabling individual investors to deploytheir capital invested in a diversified portfolioof securities.And in that capacity, mutual funds serve as intermediaries.They connect individual investorsto the broad fixed income market.Hedge funds are also players in multiple capital markets,including in fixed income markets.We think of hedge funds as investors in these securities.They, of course, are also intermediariesbecause hedge funds ultimately operate with capital that theyreceive from their investors.Banks and individuals are also buyersof fixed income securities.

PROFESSOR: Next, we introduce the concept of yield curve.Let's first consider cash flows of fixed-income securitiesor bonds.There are three important characteristicsthat define a bond--time to maturity; the principal payment,which is the payment that the bond ispromising at the maturity date; and the coupon.For example, the bond that you can see hereis a three-year bond with a $1,000 face value, or principalvalue, and a 5% annual coupon.So each year, bond investors receive $50 in coupons.And at the maturity date, in addition to the last couponpayment, they receive a $1,000 principal payment.We are going to value fixed-income securities usingabsence of arbitrage or the law of one price.We are going to limit our attention to situations wheredefault risk is irrelevant.And the only dimension we are going to focus onis the time value of money.In other words, we are going to develop arbitrage relationfor risk-free bonds, default-free bonds.Prices of various fixed-income securitiesprovide information that we need to value other cash flows,other risk-free cash flows.Markets provide various sources of informationabout prices of bonds.We could infer discount rates for different maturitiesfrom prices of pure discount bonds--these are bonds that do not pay coupons--from prices of regular coupon bondsor from other fixed-income securities.At the end of the day, all of these various securitiesare connected to each other by the law of one priceor by absence of arbitrage.And we can use any combination of fixed-income assetsas long as there is sufficient leverageto infer prices of other fixed-income securities.Next, we define the spot interest rate.The spot interest rate varies with maturity.The spot interest rate for maturity tis the rate of return that the fixed-income investoris going to receive by investing today and collecting the payofft periods from now, t years from now.Spot interest rates are indexed by their term, t.So when we talk about spot interest rates,we are talking about the entire termstructure of interest rates.For each maturity, there is a corresponding interest rate.This collection of interest ratescorresponding to different maturitiesis called the yield curve.If you look at the snapshot of the yield curve,on the 8th of June of 2019, you cansee that the spot rates differ across maturities.For example, if you were to invest for a period of oneyear, the interest rate-- the risk-free rate in the market--would be 1.99%.If you invest for a period of 30 years,the interest rate is different.It's 2.57%.It is higher in this case.The shape of the yield curve does notstay constant over time.It varies.And next, we are going to discusshow the shape of the yield curve changeswith economic conditions.On this graph, you can see the historyof interest rates or the yield curve from 1977 until 2019.There are several lines on the graph,which correspond to interest rates of different maturities.These are color coded.We are looking at interest rates for 1, 3, 5, 10, and 30 yearsto maturity.One thing we can see is that there is a common componentin all of these interest rates.They tend to move to some degree together.That's an important property of the yield curve.There is something common about movements in interest rates.Historically, what we observed is that over the last two,three decades, interest rates across maturitieshave been generally declining and arenow at a relatively low level comparedto the beginning of this sample, whichwas late '70s and early '80s.Another observation is that the differencebetween the rates of various maturitiesdoes not stay constant either.There are periods when interest rates across maturitiesare quite different.Generally, interest rates on short-maturity bonds,short-maturity fixed-income securities,are lower than interest rates for longer maturities.There are times when interest rates seemto converge across maturities.And sometimes, the yield curve even flips, in a sensethat short-term interest rates are higher than long term.There is a correlation between these eventsand general economic conditions.What we have seen historically is that typically, convergenceof interest rates or inversion of the yieldcurve with the long rates declining relativeto short rates tends to happen at the beginningof recessionary periods.This is not an exact law.It is a statistical relation.

PROFESSOR: Next, we talk about relative valuationof coupon bonds in relation to pure discount bonds,or zero coupon bonds.First, let's consider the relationbetween interest rates and bond prices for pure discount bonds.This is a matter of definition.Interest rates can express the rate of return on the bond.Bond prices also explains the rate of return,but in different terms.Bond prices and interest rates are directly relatedto each other.The relation is that the bond price with a face valueof $1.00 and maturity t is equal to 1 divided by 1 plusthe interest rate to the power t.In other words, the price of the bond todayis equal to the face value of the bond discountedat the rate of interest from now until the maturitydate of the bond.If we are thinking of interest ratesas the primary source of data, wecan then express bond prices as a function of the interestrates.Alternatively, if bond prices areobserved as the primary input, wecan express interest rates as a function of the bond prices.A coupon bond pays a regular streamof coupon payments in addition to the principal paymentat maturity.We're going to think of a coupon bondas a portfolio of pure discount bonds,where each of the payments delivered by the coupon bondcan be visualized as a payoff over a single discount bondwith the corresponding maturity.We are going to use low bond price, or arbitrage valuation,to establish a connection between the price of a couponbond and prices of discount bonds of various maturities.We can also go in reverse.We can start with the prices of coupon bondsand recover implied values of discount bonds.Let's consider an example.Suppose we are working with a 3-year yearbond with a $1,000 principal payment and a 5% coupon.So in the first year, the holder of the bondsreceives a payment of $50; second year, $50;the third year, it's $1,000 and the $50 coupon payment.We can think of this bond as a sequence of cash flowsthat can be replicated by a portfolio of discount bonds.In this case, we need three discount bonds.We need the bond with maturity of 1,the bond that pays off at time 1, paying $50 at the time.We the bond that matures at time 2, also paying 50.And we need a discount bond that pays $1,050 at time 3.Our coupon bond is equivalent to the portfolio of zero couponbonds.As a result, the price of the coupon bondhas to be equal to the cost of the portfolio of zero couponbonds according to the Law of One Price.If that equality was violated, then there would be arbitrage.For example, if the price of the coupon bondwere to be lower than the price of the portfolio of zero couponbonds that replicate its cash flows,an investor could buy a coupon bondand short sell the replicating portfolio of pure discountbonds to lock in arbitrage profits.We can generalize this argument to any coupon paying bond.Of course, there was nothing special about our 3-year bond.And we arrive at the general formulathat tells us that the price of a coupon bondis equal to a sum across the dates from oneto the maturity date of the bond, capital T,of the coupon payment of the bond times the priceof the corresponding discount bond plus the principal paymentto be multiplied by the price of the pure discount bond payingoff at time capital T. This is the formula that we see.The price of the bond is equal to the discounted valueof its cash flows, where we are discounting themat the corresponding interest rate.As an example, suppose that the yield curve is givenby the following information.The discount bond with maturity of 1 trades at 95.2 cents witha face value of $1.00.The discount rate with maturity 2 trades at 89.8 cents.The discount bond of maturity 3 trades at 86.3 cents,and so on.We do not need to know the prices of other bonds.For exercise, now we are pricing the 3-year bondthat we have seen, the price of this bondcomes out to be $998.65, which is50 times the price of a 1-year bond, which is 95.2 cents,plus $50 times the price of a 2-year bond, whichis 89.8 cents, plus $1,050 times the price of a 3-year discountbond, which is 86.3.This is a special case of the general formula bond.

PROFESSOR: We now consider a more general bond valuationproblem.Previously, we started with prices of pure discount bonds.And we figured out how to value a coupon bond.Now, we are looking at the generic situationwhere we start with prices of different types of bonds.Some are discount bonds.Some are coupon paying bonds.And we want to answer two questions.One is what are the implied interest rates?What are the prices of discount bonds?And the second question is if you observean instance of mispricing--if some of the prices are inconsistent with each other--how can you take advantage of it?How can you build an arbitrage trading strategy?So to be specific, we have three bondsto start with, A, B, and C. A is a one-year discount bondpaying $100 at time 1.B is a two-year coupon bond paying a 5% annual coupon.And C is a three-year coupon bondpaying a 10% annual coupon.And the prices of these bonds are given in the table.A trades at $96 at time 0.B trades at $99.30.And bond C trades at $108.80.We are also given bond D, which is a three-year discountbond with a face value of $100.And D trades at $84.The question is, is this bond fairly priced?And if it is not, how can we take advantage of mispricing?So to start with, we are going to collectgiven information in a matrix.It's a matrix of bond payoffs.And you could see that each of the rowscorresponds to one of the bonds, A, B, and C.And for each of the bonds, we are tabulating their cashflows.Bond A pays $100 at time 1 and 0 afterwards.Bond B pays $5 at time 1, $105 at time 2, and 0 afterwards.And bond C pays $10, $10, and $110 at time 3.Now, we are trying to find prices of discount bondsof maturities 1, 2, and 3 years.Let's call them P1, P2, and P3.Each of these bonds has a face value of $1.Let's relate prices of these bonds to the given bonds.For example, focus on bond B. This bondis equivalent to a portfolio of discount bonds--five units of a one-year bond and 105 unitsof a two-year discount bond.So we obtain a pricing equation.5 times P1 plus 105 times P2 plus 0 times P3 is equalto $99.30.We can obtain a similar pricing equation for bonds A and C.As a result, we have a system of equations,three equations, each one correspondingto a price of a single bond.And we have three unknowns, each one correspondingto a price of a discount bond, 1, 2, and 3.This system of equations has a unique solution,which you can compute.And what we find is that P1, the price of a one-year discountbond, is $0.96 cents.P2 is $0.90.And P3 is $0.82.What we have done is we recoveredprices of discount bonds.Or in other words, we recovered the spot interest ratesfrom the collection of prices of various fixed incomesecurities, different types of bonds--coupon bonds and discount bonds.Now, looking at our solution, we cansee that the price of the bond D is notconsistent with the prices of A, B, and C. D trades at $84,but the implied price for a three-year discount bondis $82.So D is not fairly priced relative to A, B, and C.How can we take advantage of this situation?We are going to build an arbitrage strategy.Let's recall that an arbitrage strategy issupposed to be self-financing.It does not require any infusion of capital.It's supposed to be risk free.There is no risk of losing money.And it's supposed to be profitable.There should be a positive probability of generatinga positive cash flow.So we're going to construct a portfolio of bonds A,B, C, and D to generate arbitrage profits.Let's call our positions xA, xB, xC, and xD respectively.And x refers to the number of sharesof each of these securities in our portfolio.Our objective is going to be to generatea cash flow of $1 at time 0 and nothing in periods 1, 2, and 3.Of course, this is arbitrage.There is no risk of a loss.And we get $1 for free at time 0.That's the free lunch arbitrage.Now, this requirement can be expressedas a system of four equations.Each equation corresponds to the cash flowcoming out of the portfolio in a given period.The first row corresponds to time 0; second, time 1;2; and 3 respectively.So now, for the first period, we wantto generate a cash flow of $1.The cash flow that the portfolio producescan be computed as a function of the portfolio positions, xA,xB, xC, and xD.In particular, when you buy a security-- let's say,you're buying bond A--you are generating a negative cash flowfor each share you buy.The negative cash flow is equal to the negative of the priceof the bond at time 0.At time 1, you generate a positive cash flow, $100,which corresponds to the payoff of the bond.And then because the bond expires at time 1,it pays nothing in periods 2 and 3.So looking at time 0, the cash flow of the portfoliois going to be minus $96 times xA--that's the contribution of bond A--minus $99.3, which is the price of bond B,times xB, and so forth.So we're summing, across all four bonds,the size of the position times the negative of the bond price.The combined cash flow at time 0 is supposed to be $1.That's the requirement for our arbitrage strategy.At time 1, we want the strategy to pay off 0.So the cash flow of bond A times the number of shares,which is 100 times xA, plus the cash flow of bond B,which is 5 times the number of shares-- times xB--plus 10 times xC-- that's contribution of bond C--plus 0 times xD, because bond D does notpay anything at time 1.That sum has to be equal to 0.And so we obtain the same kind of equationfor time 2 and time 3.We have four equations and four unknowns.The unknowns are the positions in the portfolio for bonds A,B, C, and D. The system of equationshas a unique solution, which we find.What we see is that we can indeedgenerate arbitrage profits.We knew that because prices were internally inconsistent.And to do that, we have to take a short position in bond Aand in bond B. The size of the positionis minus 0.0433 shares.We take a long position in bond C. The size is 0.4545 shares.And we short half a share of bond D. The strategyhas no risk of a loss and generates a single dollarof profit at time 0.In conclusion, what this example illustratesis that when you observe a rich set of fixed-income securities,you can infer prices of various other assets.You can price securities relative to each other.There are strong arbitrage-based restrictionson the relative prices of assets in fixed-income markets.In particular, prices of coupon bondscan be used to infer prices of discount bonds,or in other words, spot interest rates.We can therefore recover the yield curvefrom the prices of coupon bonds.So far, we looked at arbitrage restrictionsin a static framework.Our trading strategy was one short trade at time 0.We generated arbitrage profits.These arbitrage-based methods are more general than that.And they can be used in a dynamic setting thatcan be applied over time.To do that, we need to build modelswhich are dynamic, that incorporate tradingover multiple periods.And this is a subject for future lectures.

PROFESSOR: Next, we introduce an important conceptin fixed-income markets called yield to maturity.If you open the Wall Street Journalor you look at quotes for bond priceson Bloomberg or another data source,you're going to see that bond prices are typicallyquoted not in dollars but in terms of their yieldto maturity.Yield to maturity of the bond is defined as the rate of returnsuch that if it is applied across all of the maturitiesfrom 1 to capital T, then the discounted valueof the cash flows paid by the bondis equal to the bond price.In other words, as you can see from the formula, if youpretend that spot rates across all of the maturitiesare the same and equal to yield to maturity,then you should recover the bond price.Yield to maturity is thus defined as the solutionof this equation.Yield to maturity is a quoting convention.It's a way of quoting bond prices.It does not represent the rate of returnthat the bond investor collects.It is simply a way of summarizingprice information of the bond in a way that'srelatively intuitive.Yield to maturities cannot be used to compare bonds to eachother.A bond with a high yield to maturitydoes not necessarily pay a higher returnor represent a better deal to the investors.Again, these are simply quoting conventions.Based on the definition, yield to maturityis a somewhat complex weighted averageof spot rates across maturities.It's a weighted average of interest rates.Consider the following example.Suppose that the 1-year interest rate is 5%,and the 2-year rate is 6%.These are the spot rates.These are the rates of interest that investorscan collect in the market.Now consider a 2-year treasury with a principal paymentof $100 and a coupon rate of 6%.This bond pays $6 in the first yearand $106 in the second year.Let's apply the definition of yield to maturity to this bond.First, we compute the bond price.The price of this bond is equal to 6the first payment discounted to the 5% rateover a single year plus 106--that's the second payment--discounted at the 6% interest rate over two years.The total value, the price of this bond, is $100.05.To compute the yield to maturity for this bond,we now need to solve the equation.$6 discounted at the rate y, yieldto maturity, over a single year plus $106 discounted at yieldto maturity over two years has to equalthe price of the bond, $100.05.It turns out that the solution to this equation is 5.97%.That is the yield to maturity of our bond.If we plug this into the definition of yieldto maturity, we see the discounting cashflows of this bond at 5.97% recovers the bond price.As you can see, yield to maturityfalls somewhere between the two interest rates.It's between 5% and 6%.It's a lot closer to 6% because mostof the cash flows of this bond are paid at time 2.In other words, yield to maturityis some kind of weighted average of the spot rates.But it is not a simple arithmetic average.It's a solution of a somewhat complicated equation.So it's a nonlinear function of the spot rates.Yield to maturity has several simple propertiesin relation to the coupon rate of the bond, whichare useful to keep in mind for thinking qualitativelyabout how prices of bonds, their coupon rates, and yieldto maturity are related to each other.First of all, bond price is inverselyrelated to yield to maturity.As you increase yield to maturity,you're discounting cash flows of the bond at a higher rate.And of course, the bond price then declines.The second property is that the bond sells at par,meaning that the price of the bondis equal to the principal payment,if and only if yield to maturity is equal to the coupon rate.To see why that is the case, considera bond with the principal paymentof 1 and the coupon rate c.The price of this bond is equal to the sumof its coupons discounted at the yieldto maturity y plus the principal payment, whichis 1, discounted at the yield to maturity back to time 0.If we use the formula for an annuity with a rate of returny, we can rewrite the price of the bond as a sum of two termsthat you can see on the right-hand side.The important thing to note here isthat if the yield to maturity is equal to c, the couponrate of the bond, the second term disappears and becomesequal to 0.And the first term equals 1.So the bond price is 1, which is the principal payment.What this equation tells us is that when yield to maturityequals the coupon rate, the bond priceis equal to the principal payment of the bond.The bond price is declining as a function of yieldto maturity, which means that if yield to maturityexceeds the coupon payment, the bond price is going to tradeat a level below the principal.In this case, we say that the bond trades at a discount.It trades below the par value.If the yield to maturity is lower than the coupon rate,then the bond is going to trade at a premium,meaning that the price of the bondwill exceed the principal payment.

PROFESSOR: Next, we're going to discusssome of the properties of yield curve dynamicsand the models that describe how interestrates of various maturities are related to each other.Let's start with the expectations hypothesis,which is an important theory about propertiesof interest rates.It is an important benchmark.To introduce this idea, let's considertwo alternative investment strategies.Strategy one is very simple.We start with $1 and invest it into a 10-year discount bond.Strategy two, invest the same dollar into a 9-year discountbond, and then reinvest the proceedsof that first investment over an additional 1-year period.Of course, we reinvest it at the 1-year spot rate at that time,between years 9 and 10.Under the expectations hypothesis,we assume that bonds do not carry a risk premium, whichmeans that all of these types of investment strategiesthat move money between time 0 and time 10by investing in different bonds and maybe reinvesting-- theyall earn the same expected rate of return.In other words, under the expectations hypothesis,the expected return on strategy twohas to be equal to the expected return on strategy one.Let's explore the implication of this idea.First, introduce a new piece of notation.r sub s as a function of t is goingto denote the spot interest rate at time t with a maturity s.By default, we're going to set t equal to 0.So we're talking about interest rates at time 0.Consider our two strategies-- strategy one, strategy two.In the formula, the total return of strategy oneappears on the right-hand side.It is equal to 1 plus the 10-year spotrate raised to power 10.The expected return on strategy two is on the left-hand side.Notice that the realized return of strategy two is 1 plusthe 9-year spot rate as of time 0 raised to power 9--that's the return on the first leg of the strategyand the investment in that 9-year discount bond--times 1 plus the 1-year spot rate as of time 9.This is the second leg of the strategy.And note that there is a squiggle-- the tilde-- on topof that interest rate, which reminds usthat the spot rate at time 9 is a random variable.It is not known as of time 0.The expectations hypothesis equates the expected valueof the left-hand side and the right-hand side.Of course, the right-hand side is not random.We know exactly what the spot rate for a 10-year investmentis as of time 0.It's a 10-year spot interest rate.Now, if we rearrange the terms in this equation,we can relate the expected value of a 1-year spot rate at time 9to the spot rate at time 0 for maturities of 9 and 10.This equation tells us that the expected value of a 9-year spotrate is equal to the ratio of 1 plus the 10-year rate raisedto power 10 divided by 1 plus the 9-year spotrate raised to power 9 minus 1.Under the expectations hypothesis,the slope of the yield curve predicts future spot rates.To see what that means, let's consider our formula closely.Expected value of a 1-year spot rate at time 9can be expressed as the ratio of 1 plus the 10-year spot rateto power 9 divided by 1 plus the 9-year spot rate to power 9times 1 plus the 10-year spot rate minus 1.Suppose that the 10-year spot rateis above the 9-year rate as of time 0.In other words, the yield curve is upwardsloping between years 9 and 10.With that information, we can seethat the first term in the formulais going to be at least as high as 1 plus the 10-year spotrate.And so as a result, the expected interest rateover a single year at time 9 has to be higherthan the 10-year spot rate at time 0.In other words, when the yield curve is upward sloping,it's telling us that the expected spotrate in the future has to be relatively high.If the yield curve was downward sloping,we would find the reverse, that the expected spot rateat time 9 is relatively low.Now, in a special case when the 10-year rateis equal to the 9-year rate, using the formula,we can see that the expected value of a 1-year spotrate at time 9 is equal to the 10-year or the 9-year spotrates at time 0.More generally, the expectations hypothesistells us there is a relation between expected future spotrates and the current spot rates.This is a direct generalization of the equationthat we derived in our example.The expected 1-year rate at time tis related to the spot rates for periods t and t plus 1.Specifically, it's the ratio of 1plus the spot rate for period t plus 1 raised to power tplus 1 divided by 1 plus the t period spotrate raised to power t minus 1.Under the expectations hypothesis,the expected value of the future interest ratesis based on the current interest rates.As an alternative to the expectations hypothesis,consider the following so-called liquidity hypothesis.Under this idea, investors regard long-term bondsas relatively risky relative to short-term bonds.For example, if you are an investor with a relativelyshort horizon, and you buy a long-term bond,at the end of your investment periodwhen you liquidate your position, the payoff is random.It depends on the future interest rates.In contrast, if you invest into a short-term bond,your payoff could be relatively less risky or even fixed.That's one of the arguments that could be used to justifythe liquidity preference.More generally, under the liquidity preferencehypothesis, the equation that we derived for the expectationshypothesis needs to be modified.The right-hand side is the same.It relates spot rates of different maturities.On the left-hand side, what we seeis that in addition to the expected future spot rate,we have an additional term, lambda,which represents the so-called risk premium or a liquiditypremium.In other words, the slope of the yield curve over various pointsdown the curve between time t and t plus 1represents not only the expected future spot rate, but alsoan adjustment that accounts for riskinessof bonds of long maturities.The implication of this hypothesisis that if lambda is positive, than the long bonds on averagereceive a higher rate of return than the short-term bonds.In other words, if you're thinkingabout predicting interest rates using the shape of the yieldcurve, this tells us that the spot interestrates of long maturities overpredictthe future short-term rates.So if you use the expectations hypothesis formula,and you form a forecast of the spot rate using that relation,that forecast is going to be biased.It's going to be upward biased.And the reason for that is that the slope of the yieldcurve between various points is not equal to the expected spotrate, but also accounts for a liquidity or a risk premium.Historically, long-term bonds produced higher average ratesof return than short-term bonds.For instance, if you look at the period from 1926 until 2018,the average rate of return on short-term Treasurybonds in the US, the Treasury bills, has been 3.4%.In comparison, long-term bonds earned 5.9%.This highlights the fact that, on average, long-term bondsproduce a higher rate of return than short-term bonds.This empirical fact tells us that the expectationshypothesis does not describe market dynamics very well.Under the expectations hypothesis,average rates of return on long-term bondsand on short-term bonds would have to be the same.Empirically, they're quite different.So why do long-term bonds earn a higher rate of return?Why is there a positive spread or the positive risk premiumattached to the long-term bonds?There could be several potential reasons for that.One reason is that short-term bonds are in a way money-like.They are relatively liquid.They hold their value better in the short runthan long-term bonds.If investors have needs for these types of securities thatare relatively safe over short horizons,then they will be willing to pay more for short-term bonds.In other words, they will be willing to accept lowerrates of return on these bonds.The rate of return on cash, on money, is 0.And short-term bonds, which are money-like,accordingly would have to have lower rates of return.That's one argument.Another reason for why long-term bondsmay pay higher rates of return than short-term bondsis because they are more exposed to inflation risk.We're talking about nominal bonds here.They lose value when inflation spikes.Suppose there is news that inflation in the futureis going to be higher.This news is going to reduce the value of long-term bondsand is going to raise future interest rates.Short-term bonds are relatively immune to these typesof shocks.As a result, inflation risk is goingto affect long-term bond investorsmore than those invested in short-term securities.This could be one reason why investors in long-term bondswould demand a higher rate of returnto compensate them for inflation risk.We have seen a couple of theoriesthat talk about various determinants of yieldsor interest rates across maturities.Expectations of future spot rates, of course,affect interest rates of various maturities.But that is not the whole story.Risk of long-term bonds is also important.So expectations of future rates and their riskultimately determine the shape of the yield curve.Expectations hypothesis assumes that there is no risk premium,that interest rates across maturitiesare based on the expected future spot rates.The liquidity preference hypothesisincorporates considerations of risk.But it is not very specific about how, exactly, riskaffects spot rates across the yield curve.There are more explicit, dynamic theories of the term structurethat develop mathematical models of howinterest rates across maturities evolve across timeand how their behavior is shaped by expectationsof future rates and their risk.Examples of these are the Vasicek model,the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross model, and so forth.You can learn more about these dynamic models of the yieldcurve in the fixed income course.

PROFESSOR: Next, we consider the concept of interest rate risk.And in particular, we will introduce the conceptof bond duration, which is a quantitative measure of riskexposure of bonds.Now, bonds are fixed-income securities,but they're not risk free.If you invest in a long-term bond and interest rates change,the value of the bond will change accordingly.Movements in interest rates are uncertain.They're random.And therefore, changes in bond prices or bonds returnsare also random.They're risky.Now, if you look at the graph here,you could see how the bond price dependson the yield of the bond.The relation is negative.As the yield on the bonds rises, the bond price falls.This negative relation is going to tell ushow sensitive bond prices are to changes in yieldsor in interest rates.As an example, suppose that the term structure is flat.All spot interest rates are equal to y.Let's say that at the yield of 5%,the price of a particular bond is $90.If yields suddenly move to 4%, the bond price rises.Let's say, it rises to $91.80.The relative price change of the bond is 91.8 minus 90 over 90--that's the bond's return--equal to 2%.If we normalize the return of the bondby the change in the yield, the ratioof 2% bond return to 1% change in the yield is 2.In this case, we can think of this numberas a quantitative measure of risk.It's a measure of sensitivity of the bondprice to changes in the yield.Notice that we've changed the sign here.The yield change is in fact minus 1%.This is a common convention.We want our risk measure to be positive,so we're going to change the sign to achieve that.Now more generally, we're going to measure risk of the bondby looking at the infinitesimal changes in the yieldand how bond prices respond to said changes.This is going to define a measure of bond risk.Mathematically, we are going to measure bond risk using whatis called modified duration, whichis defined as the negative of the derivative of the bondprice with respect to the yield change,normalized by the bond price itself.In other words, this is the infinitesimal changein the bond price in percentage terms dividedby the infinitesimal change in the level of interestrates in the yields.Now, consider as a special case a pure discount bond.This is a t period bond, which trades at the price Bt.That price is equal to 1 plus the yield raisedto power minus t.If we substitute this bond price into the definition of modifiedduration, we find that for the pure discount bond,modified duration is equal to t, the maturity of the bond--time to maturity--divided by 1 plus the yield.In other words, modified durationof the bond and its time to maturity are closely linked.For a pure discount bond, modified durationtimes 1 plus the yield is equal to time to maturity.This relation suggests that thereis a physical, intuitive interpretationof bond duration.It has a lot to do with the maturity structure of the cashflows of the bond.Next, we introduce a closely related concept,Macauley duration, which makes it even more clearthat bond duration and maturity structure of its cash flowsare directly connected.So consider a general stream of cash flows--risk-free cash flows.Call them CFt for period t.We define Macauley duration as follows.For each tenor t, we compute the present valueof the corresponding cash flow.We normalize it by the total value of the cash flow, B.And we use this as a weight.And using these weights, we average the tenors from 1to capital T.According to this definition, each tenor tcontributes something to Macauley duration.And it contributes more if the corresponding cashflow is larger, if it accounts for a largerfraction of the total price of the security.Physically, you could think of thisas a definition of the center of gravity of the payment tenors.As it turns out, Macauley durationand the modified duration that we just definedare directly related to each other.And in fact, modified duration is Macauley durationnormalized by 1 plus the yield.So what we see is that modified durationis proportional to the weighted average of the payment tenorswhere the weights are proportionalto the present value of the corresponding cash flows.Indeed, the duration of the bond is directlybased on the term structure of its payments.Next, consider an empirical example.Instead of computing bond durationbased on the term structure of its payments,we can estimate its duration by runninga regression of bond returns on changes in yields,or changes in interest rates.We'll look at several examples.We'll look at 5-year Treasuries, 10-year Treasuries,and 30-year Treasuries.As you can see from the first graph,changes in the price of a 5-year Treasury bond returnsare closely linked to movements in interest rates.There is a very strong statistical relationbetween them.And the slope coefficient is less than 5.What this is telling us is that the factorof duration of a 5-year treasury is less than 5.And that is because these bonds pay coupons.And as a result, the center of gravity of their paymentsis somewhere between 0 and 5 years.It's close to 5 years, because the bulk of the paymentscomes at the maturity date of the bond.We observe a similar picture for the 10-yearand the 30-year bond.Again, bond returns are explained very wellby changes in the level of interest rates.And the slope coefficient in these regressionsis closely related to the maturity structure of the bondpayment.It is under 10 years for a 10-year bond.And it's somewhere between 0 and 30 years for a 30-year bond.

PROFESSOR: Bond duration can be used as a measure of bond risk.Now, let's take a closer look at how wellbond duration approximates the risk of the bond.Consider the following example.We have a four-year treasury note with a face value of 100and a 7% coupon, which is paid semiannually.So every six month, this bond pays $3.50 in coupons.In the following table, you can see the cash flows of the bond.It's 3.50 every six month.And the payment of $103.5 at the maturity date.Now, for this bond we can compute the Macaulay durationas a weighted average of the payment tenors.And that happens to be equal to 7.13 periods.Each period is half a year.So this is a little less than four years.And the modified duration, which is Macaulay duration dividedby bond plus the yield on the bond, 1 plus 3%,is equal to 6.92 periods.So it's a little bit shorter than three and 1/2 years.Based on this number, based on the modified duration,our infinitesimal formula can be used to approximate riskexposure of the bond.The formula tells us that when the semiannual yield movesby 0.1%, the bond price should decrease by roughly 0.692%.The approximate change in the bond in percentage termsshould be equal to the modified durationtimes the change in the yield.Now, this approximation is based on the infinitesimal analysis.It's based on the Taylor approximation, Taylor expansionof changes in the bond price.What happens if yields move by a larger amount?Is this formula going to remain accurate?Let's do an experiment.We're going to change yields by large amounts,and see how the bond price responds.In the following table, you couldsee the price of our bond exactly computedas a function of several different values of the bondyield.In the middle of the table, we seethat when the bond yield in semiannual terms is 3%,the price of the bond is 103.5.Now, we can compute bond price for different yield levelsexactly, or we can compute it approximately basedon the modified duration number.What we see here is that when yields change by 10 basispoints from 3% to 3.1, the exact bond pricemoves from 103.5 to $102.79.And the duration based formula is producing a highly accurateapproximation.It's giving us basically the same number.So the difference shows up in higher order digitspast the decimal point.Now, let's assume that the yield changes by a large amount.It goes from 3% to 4%.Now, the price of the bond drops to $96.63.That's the exact bond price.And the approximation based on modified durationis giving us $96.35.Now, we can see that there is a difference.The duration-based formula is under-predicting the bondprice.The exact price is higher than what we getbased on the duration formula.This is not surprising.The modified duration is a first order approximationthe price changes of the bond.But the exact relation within the bond price and the yieldis nonlinear.Therefore, when changes in the bond price are large,we need to think of higher order approximations.We can see this annotation clearly in the following graph.The red line here corresponds to the exact price of the bondas a function of the yield.The blue line is a linear approximation.It's giving us a very accurate description of the bond priceif changes in the yield are small.But it kind of falls short when changes in the yield are large.This blue line corresponds to the duration-basedapproximation.Our duration number is given as the slopein the relation between the bond price and the yield.If we want to account for the nonlinearity,if you want to capture the most important nonlinearterm, the curvature of this curve,we need to introduce higher order charts.So curvature or convexity of this curveneed to be captured by an additional term.And that term is called the convexity term.Algebraically, what we can do is expand the bond pricein a Taylor series as a function of changes in the bond yield.The leading term, which is a derivativeof the bond with respect to the yield times the changein the yield, the first order term,is captured by the modified duration.Modified duration is the negative of this derivativeof the bond price with respect to the yield.The second order term in the Taylor expansion,the quadratic term, is what we call bond convexity.So from the Taylor expansion, we cansee that the natural definition for bond convexityis one half of the second derivative of the bond pricewith respect to the yield divided by the bond priceitself.The second order term is going to give usan additional degree of approximation thatgoes beyond the leading term, the duration-based term.Let's see how much the convexity termhelps when the approximate bond price changesunder large movements in the yield curve.Suppose we are looking at a 10-year bond with a 10% couponand a 10% flat yield curve.The modified duration of this 10-year bond is 6.23 years.Now, if you look at the column in the center of the table,this corresponds to the initial position of the bond.The yield change is zero.There is no movement in the price.We're now going to consider different changes in the yield.For example, what if the yield on the bondmoves up by 100 basis points, or by 1%?The total change in the bond price is going to be minus $6.The bond price falls by $6.The duration-based approximation will tell usthat the bond price falls by $6.2.There is an approximation error of $0.20.The convexity term is going to correct that to some degree.It's going to give us plus $0.30.At the end of the day when we sum up all of these terms,we see that the approximation is quite accurate.The error is less than 10 basis points.If the yield change is larger than that, for example,300 basis points, 3%, the total decline in the bond price isgoing to be $16.50.The duration-based approximation is goingto be relatively inaccurate.It will give us $18.70 decline.The convexity correction is going to be $2.40.And the overall error is going to be quite modest,about $0.20.What we see from this illustrationis that the convexity approximation, the convexityterm, provides a useful degree of correctionwhen we are concerned with large movements in the yield curve.

PROFESSOR: We now consider another important dimensionof bond risk, which is inflation risk.Bond payoffs are nominal.As a result, as the price level changes,as inflation rate changes, the real value of the bondis affected.Real payoffs are affected by inflation.So let's recall what inflation is.Inflation is the rate of change of the nominal price level.If you're thinking about prices of consumption goods,let's say the price of a burger, it may be $5 this yearand $6 five years from now.What this means is that, for the same consumption good,the nominal price level is changingby 20% over a five-year period.This process of changes in nominal pricesis what we call inflation.As the price level rises, the real valueof the purchasing power of a single unit of money,let's say of $1, falls.So the purchasing power of currency and the price levelare negatively related.As a result, payoffs of nominal securities, like bonds,are sensitive to inflation.As inflation rises, the real value of the payoffs declines.So let's look at the following exampleto illustrate the point.Suppose that inflation next year, realized inflation rate,is uncertain.On average, we expect inflation to be 8%.But in reality, it could be higher or lower.Let's say that there are three possible values equallylikely--10%, 8%, or 6.The real interest rate is 2%.This is the risk-free rate of return in real terms,not in nominal terms.The 1-year nominal interest rate is approximately 10%to correct for inflation.As a result, depending on the realized inflation,the real return on the 1-year Treasury bondis going to be different.If inflation happens to be 8%, exactly as expected,the nominal payoff of the bond, which is $1,100,is going to be worth $1,019 in real terms.If inflation happens to be higher than expected,the 10%, the same nominal payoff is going to be worth only 1,000in real terms.If inflation is lower, 6%, that payoffis going to be more valuable.It's going to be $1,038.The point is that while nominal securities, like Treasurybonds, may produce safe payoffs in nominal terms,the payoff is risky in real terms.Inflation risk is particularly importantfor long-horizon investors, who are concernedwith accumulating wealth.For example, if you're thinking about the household savingfor retirement, it would care a lotabout the purchasing power of their savings rather thanthe nominal value.And, for them, inflation risk would be a first order concern.

PROFESSOR: In this question, I will teach youhow to find spot interest rates from given bond prices.In this question we're given three bonds--Bond A, Bond B, and Bond C. Bond A has 0% couponand has one year until it matures.Bond B has a 3% coupon rate and has two years until it matures.And bond C has a 3.5% coupon rateand has three years until maturity.Bond prices are given as such.So Bond A costs $97.60 right now.Bond B costs $96.And Bond C costs $98.So the goal is to take this informationabout the bonds in green here and find spot interestrates for Years 1, 2, and 3.So this is the question.The first step that we'll do hereis that we will write the prices of these bondsas the function of interest rates.So let's start with bond A.So the price of Bond A, PA would equal to $1 face valuethat this bond pays at the end of Year 1 dividedby 1 plus interest rate r1.So this is the one-year spot interest rate.One thing to know here is that all of the bondshave $100 face value.And all of these bonds are risk free.So we are talking about spot interest rates, risk-free spotinterest rates.So this is for bond A.The next step is to write the priceas the function of the coupon and interest rates for bond B.So Bond B has two years until maturity and pays 3% coupon.This means that if we are the holder of this bondwe will get $3 at the end of year one, whichis our first coupon.We'll get $3 at the end of year two, whichis our second coupon.And then we will get the face value of $100 paidto us at the end of year two.So now what we do is we're discounting these couponpayments and the face value to present usingthe appropriate discount rates.So the first $3 we get at the end of Year 1.So therefore we're discounting it by discount rate r1.And the second payment, the last coupon in the face value,we're getting at the end of Year 2.And therefore, we're discounting it to present.We're using r2 as the discount rate.Hence power of 2 here because this paymentcomes at the end of Year 2.The final step is to do the same thing for Bond C.So the price of Bond C, this bond has three yearsuntil maturity, base coupon 3.5%, so 3.5 dollarsdiscounted by 1 plus r1.So this is our first payment.Our second payment is the next coupon $3.50 discountedto present at discount rate r2 raised to the power of 2because this payment occurs in Year 2.And finally we get our last couponat the end of year three.We get face value of this bond as well at the end Year 3.And we're discounting it to presentusing r3 as a discount rate.And we're raising it the power of 3because this payment occurs at the end of Year 3.Now the goal is to find spot interest rates r1, r2, and r3.I've written down the prices of these bonds right here.So they are given to us.So what we effectively have here isthat we have a system of three equations with three unknowns.And notice that this is an easy system to solve in the sensethat the first equation has only one unknown, r1.So we can solve this equation, plug this r1into the second equation, at which pointthis ratio will become known.And this will just become an equation with one unknown, r2.At which point we can solve this equation for r2,plug our known r1 and r2 into the last equation,and solve this last equation for r3.And so this is exactly what I'm going to do now.So I'm going to start solving the first equation for r1.So r1 is going to be equal to $100 divided by $97.50 minus 1.So this would give me the first spot interest rate, r1.So I solved this first equation for the first spot interestrate, r1.And the answer is r1 equals to 2.56%.Now the next step is to take this known r1and put it into the second equation.I've erased the third equation here right now so that Ihave more space to work here.So what I will do here is that I will plug thisinto this equation.And I will get the following.So I'll get 96 equals to $3 divided by 1plus 2.56% plus 103 divided by 1 plus r2 raised to power of 2.This is a known number that we can compute.And so this just becomes an equationwith one unknown, which I can solve for r2.I just solved this equation for r2.So r2 equals to 5.2%.Now the last step is to find r3.So I've written down back the bond pricingequation that we had before for Bond C.And so right now what I will do isthat I will take again r1 that we computed beforeand I will put it down here.And I will also do the new r2 that we found.And I'll put it into this last equationas well, at which point again this will become just oneequation with one unknown.So let's do it.So $98 equals to 3 and 1/2, 1 plus 2.56% plus another 3.5,that's our second coupon, divided by 1 plus 5.2%squared plus 103.5 Divided by 1 plus r3 raised to power of 3.So this we can compute.This we can compute.And again, this just becomes one equation with one unknown.So the goal right now is to solve this equation for r3.So I just solved this equation for r3and I found that r3 equals to 4.22%.And that's how we find spot interest rates.So r1 equals to 2.56%.r2 equals to 5.2%.And r3 equals to 4.22%.This is the answer to this question.So this is how we find from given bond prices.This is how we find spot interest rates.When we start with finding the closest or the shortestinterest rate from the first given bond and thenwe continue working and finding the secondand the third interest rate.So if we're given a fourth bond and we were given four periods,we would continue doing that, and just solving this equationand stripping these spot interest rates.Now the last step what I will showis that I want to actually use this discount rateand make sure that I solve this question correctly in the sensethat if I were to price those bonds using this termstructure spot interest rates, that I would actually getthe prices that we were given.And I will show this to you right now.So let's compute the prices given the interestrate that we just found.So the price of Bond A would equal to,again, it's a zero-coupon bond, one year to maturity.So it's $100 divided by 1 plus r1.So r1 right now equals to 2.56%.So if we compute this price of this Bond A,what we will find is that it equals to $97.50.The price of Bond B would equal to the first coupon,so $3 divided by 1 plus r1 which is2.56% plus the last coupon plus the face valuedivided by r2 which is 5.2% raised to the power of twobecause this cash flow occurs at the end of Year 2.So if we compute this price right nowwith this interest rate, what we will findis that the price of this bond is indeed$96, the number that was given to us in this question.Finally, the bond price C equals to the first coupon payment3.5 dollars because this bond, again, has 3.5% coupon rate,divided by 1 plus 2.56%.This is our r1.Second coupon, $3.50 divided by 1 plus the second discountrate, r2, Plus the last coupon payment,3.5 plus the face value received at the end of Year 3it's counted by 1 plus r3.That's 4.22% raised to the power of 3again because this cash flow occurs at the end of Year 3.So if we compute this price, we will findthat it also equals to $98.So what we've done, we've confirmedthat the discount rates that we've found from given bondprices, if we plug them back in and tryto price those bonds with these discount rates,it will, indeed, find the numbers or the bond prices thatwere given in this question, which means that we have solvedthis question correctly.

PROFESSOR: In this question, we willlearn how to identify arbitrage opportunities in the bondmarket and how to take advantage of such opportunities.Suppose that you're a bond traderand you see the following bonds and their priceson your screen.So there are three bonds--A, B, and C. All three have face value of $100.They have corresponding maturitiesof one, two, and three years, following coupon ratesand prices.Now there is another bond, bond D, that just became availablein the market.It has the same face value of $100 as bonds A, B,and C. It has three years to maturity and a 3% coupon rate.Its current price is $99.50.The first question asks us, if there is an arbitrageopportunity in this market, and if yesasks us to explain how we would takeadvantage of such opportunity.The first step that we will do in this questionis that we will find the term structure of interest ratesbased on the prices of bonds that are given to us.So in particular, we would use pricesof bonds A, B, and C to find interest rates r1, r2, and r3.So these are the spot interest ratesfor Year 1, Year 2, and Year 3.We would, generally speaking, followexactly the same approach as we'velearned in the first question that we've covered.So let's start with bond A. The price of bond A is given to usas $96.90.So the current price of this bondbecause this is a zero coupon bond,it pays $100 which is its face value at the end of year 1.So therefore the current price shouldequal to the face value discountedto present at the one-year spot interest rate.So we have this first equation.What we do is that we solve this equationfor r1, which gives us one-year spot interest rate, r1.In this case, it equals to 3.2%.Now we turn our attention to bond B.We can write down the following pricingequation for bond B. The price of Bond B which is given to usis $99, it should be equal to the first coupon discountedto present plus the second coupon plus the face valuediscounted to present.Remember, this is a two-year maturity bond.It pays 2.75% coupon rate.So therefore the dollar value of the annual couponthat this bond pays is $2.75.So we take the first coupon and we'rediscounting it to present at one-year spot rate r1.And we take the second coupon and the face value,which we get at the end of year two.And we discount it to present at r2which is a two-year spot rate.So the goal is to solve this equation for r2.Glancing at this equation, it lookslike we have r1 and r2 in this equation.But the good news is that we alreadyknow r1, which we found from the price of bond A which was 3.2%.So therefore we can plug this r1 into the above equationand use it to solve for r2.Solving that equation for r2 gives us 3.28%.So this is year-two spot rate.So to recap what we've done so far,we've found one-year spot rate which is 3.2%,we found year-two spot rate which is 3.28%.Now the final step is to take the price of bond Cwhich is a three-year zero-coupon bond currentlytraded at $88.55.And based on this equation, we will find year three spotrate or r3.So the good news is that this equation is fairly simple.In the sense that this is a zero-coupon bond.So there are no intermediate couponsthat this bond pays in Year 1 and Year 2.We've covered a situation like this in Question 1.So here, just for simplicity, we'vegiven you a zero-coupon bond.So solving this equation for r3 becomes fairly easy.If we solve it, we get r3 that equals to 4.14%.So what we've found so far is that wefound the term structure of interest ratesfor the first three years, for Year 1, 2, and 3.So Year 1 interest rate equals the 3.2%.Year 2 interest rate equals to 3.28%.And Year 3 interest rate equals to 4.14%.Now let's examine whether bond D is priced fairlygiven the current term structure of interest rates.That, of course, assumes that bondsA, B, and C are fairly priced.So recall that bond D is, again, so ithas three years to maturity.It has 3% coupon rate.So therefore it pays $3 coupon at the end of Year 1,$3 coupon at the end of Year 2, $3 coupon at the end of Year 3,plus the face value of $100 that it alsopays at the end of Year 3.So therefore, we can write down the following equation.So we're taking the first coupon,discounting it to present at Year 1 interest rate,spot rate, which is 3.2%.We take the second coupon, which is again $3and we are discounting it to present at the Year 2 spotrate which is 3.28%.And the last payment of 3 plus $100, we'rediscounting at Year 3 spot interest rate of 4.14%.So if you compute this, it gives us the price of $96.93.But recall that the quoted price of this bond was $99.50.So therefore, bond D appears to be overpriced, overpricedrelative to its fair price.And therefore this presents an arbitrage opportunity.So to take advantage of this arbitrage opportunity, whatwe should do are generally two things.So we either sell an overpriced bondor we buy the underpriced bond, or any asset for that matter.In this case, since bond D was overpriced,to take advantage of this opportunity we should beselling this bond at the quoted price or at $99.50.

PROFESSOR: Now that we know there is arbitrage opportunityin this market, I will teach you howto construct an arbitrage trading strategy thattakes advantage of it.In particular, we will construct such a strategythat pays off $100 today and nothing in the future.I will teach a very universal approachthat you can apply to construct arbitrageopportunities in any situation.So we're going to assume that we'rebuying xA amount of bond A, xB amount of bond B,xC amount of bond C, and xD amount of bond D. We will allowfor these amounts for xA, xB, xC, and xD to be negative.This would imply that we are taking a short position,we're selling the corresponding bonds.So we want to construct a strategy that pays--gives us $100 today.We can write the following equation.Bond prices multiplied by our positionsshould add up to $100.Here the key would be that bond prices wouldcome with negative signs because we're taking--we're buying these bonds.So for example, if we're buying one unit of bond A,we will have to pay right now $96.90.This is the price of bond A. So in this case,we'll have a cash outflow of $96.90.If we are buying two units of bond A,then our cash outflow would be the price multiplied by 2.So therefore this gives us the left hand sideof this equation, which means that we're buying xA of bond A,xB of bond B, xC of bond C, and xD of bond D.And so this expression gives us our total cashoutflow that we have to spend on buying these bonds.And so this has to equal to $100 because thisis-- we want a positive cash outflow todayso we want to construct a strategy that gives us $100today.So you can immediately see that for thisto work that some of this amountsxA, xB, and xC, and xD has to be a negative sothat the corresponding cash flow is positive.So it makes sense that we would haveto take a negative position or short sell one of these bonds.You could see that it's likely goingto be bond D because we've just determinedin the previous question that this bond is actuallyoverpriced.So this is just the summary of this.Now the key to arbitrage is that our positions should be suchthat the bond payoffs or our payoffs from our tradingstrategy are zero in all of the subsequent years.And that is the definition of arbitrage.So we're making a positive amount today.So in this particular case, we're going to make $100.And are positions are fully hatched.So our cash flows are exactly zeroin all of the subsequent years.So here because the maximum maturity of the bondshere is three years so we have to make surethat in the years 1, 2, and 3 we get $0 cash flows.Let's start with Year 1.So recall that bond A is a zero couponbond with one year maturity.So it pays $100 in the year one.So therefore, the cash inflow or the positive cashflow because we bought this bond,so at the end of the year one, weget $100 times how many units of this bond we purchased,so times xA.Now bond B is a 2.75% coupon bond.And it's a two-year bond.So it pays us the first coupon at the end of Year 1.So we get 2.75 times xB.And bond D, so bond C is a zero coupon bond so it pays nothing.And it matures in year three.And bond D, it's a 3% coupon bondso it pays us for the first coupon $3at the end of year one.So hence we get the following expression and thishas to equal to $0 because, again, wehave to ensure that our cash flow at the end of year 1is exactly 0.So for Year 2 now bond A pays nothing.So it pays zero because it already matured.Now bond B matures actually at the end of year two,so it pays the second coupon of $2.75.Plus it pays the face value of $100.And bond C pays nothing because it'sa zero-coupon bond that matures at the end of year three.And bond D pays our second coupon.It pays $3.So we have the following equation, 102.75 times xBplus 3 times xD.And that equals to $0.So finally for year three, we get-- so at that point in time,bond A already matured.So it pays nothing.Bond B also matured, so it pays nothing.Bond C pays its face value.So $100.And again, recall that this is a 0% coupon bond.And bond D pays its last coupon which is$3 plus its face value, $100.So in year three we get the following equation,so 100 multiplied by xC plus 103 multiplied by xD.And that equals to $0.So let's put this all together.So we have the following four equations.So the first equation, it's our cash flow in the year one.The second equation is our cash flow in the year one.So the first one is our cash flow in the year zero.Now, let's put this all together.We have the following system of four equationswith four unknowns.These equations represent our cash flows in Years 0, 1, 2,and 3.So the goal right now is to solve this system of equationsfor xA, xB, and xC, and xD.So here it's fairly straightforwardhow to solve this.So we can see that, for example, the last twoequations, so the tie--they had just two unknowns.So they tie xB and xD.This is Equation 3.An xC an xD, this is Equation 4.So what I'm going to do is that I'mgoing to solve the last two equations for xBas a function of xD and xC as the function of xD.Now let's look at the second equation.Second equation has xA, xB, and xD.So I'm going to plug in the third equation,or xB into the second equation, and then solve it to express xAas a function of xD.So this is me first-step plugging xBas the function of xD into this second equation.And then the next step, I'm solving xA for xD.So I'm solving the second equation.And so now the second, third, and fourth equation right nowgive us xA, xB, and xC as functions of xD.And so if we plug these expressionsinto the first equation, it will give usjust equation with one unknown.So we'll have only xD in that equation.So doing that and solving that equation will give usxD equal to negative 38.85.So what this means, it means that we are selling,we are shorting 38.85 units of bond D.So here I implicitly assume that I can actuallytrade fractions of the bond.So I can buy any fraction.So in this case, I'm buying 0.85.So I'm buying 38 whole units and 85 of fraction of bond D.So now this does make economic sense.Because we've identified in the first part of this questionis that bond D was overvalued.It was overpriced.So it was priced at 99.5.Well, it's fair price was $96.So therefore it does make sense for usto take advantage of this opportunity.We have to actually sell those bonds at this higher priceand therefore get this higher value to us right now.And then we're going to be taking long positionsin the other three bonds to make surethat we get $0 payoffs in the Years 1, 2, and 3.So now, since we have xD, what we can dois that we are plugging this amountxD that we found in the equations that tie xA with xD,xB with xD, and xC with xD.And we get the following amounts for xA, xB, and xC.So xA and xB equal to 1.13, whichmeans that we are buying 1.13 units of bond A 1.13units of bond B. And we are buying 40.02 units of bond C.So we're taking long positions in these bonds.Now this is our arbitrage strategy.So we are selling 38.85 units of bond Dand we're buying the corresponding units of bondsA, B, and C. Now the final step that I want to do hereis that I want to actually verify that this tradingstrategy actually works.So what I will do is that I will plugin these amounts of xA, xB, xC, and xD that we foundinto our equations to make sure that weget the cash flows that we are thinking that we're getting.So if I am plugging these numbersinto the first equation, I get $100.So which means that me buying the corresponding amountsof bonds A, B, and C, and shortingthe corresponding amounts of bond D gives us exactly $100.In the Year 1, this equation tells us that we get exactly 0,as we expect.In Year 2, we also get 0.And in Year 3, we also get 0.So our arbitrage strategy indeed works.It gives us $100 right now.And it gives us nothing in the Years 1, 2, and 3.

PROFESSOR: Let me show you how we can automate solvingthis arbitrage question.The first step that I will do is I will write downthe system of equations that we had in the following matrixform.So I'll have matrix A. This is a 4 by 4 matrix.Then, I will have a column vector of x's.This is our unknowns, our positionsthat we're taking in this corresponding box.And this would equal to the payoffsthat we get in years 0, 1, 2, and 3.So you can see that this system of equations writtenthis way in the matrix form actually gives usthe system of equations that we had before.Now, we have to solve this for A.So all we really have to do is that we have to invert matrix Aand then, multiply it by the payoffs vector--vector b, in this case.And let me show you how to do this using Excel tools.You can, of course, do it in any other softwarethat you are more accustomed to using.So here, what I've done below is that Ihave written down this system, these numbers,into just Excel arrays.And what I will do-- so this is my matrix A,and this is my matrix B. So the goal rightnow is to invert these highlighted cells,and then multiply them by this vector b.So the first, I will use minverse function thatinverts this 4 by 4 matrix.To do this, first I have to prehighlight the locationwhere I want these numbers to be inputted by Excel.And then, I'm writing the function, so minverse.And then, I'm selecting array, where this--where I inputted these numbers.And then, this is the-- the key hereis to hit the following three keys at the same time,so I have hit Shift and Control.So I'm holding Shift and Control right now,and then I'm hitting Enter.So this way right now, Excel--what's it's done, it inverted this matrix.And so right now, what I have here on the screenis that it's inverted matrix A.So now, all I have to do is that Ihave to multiply this inverted matrix by vector b.So here, again, I will prehighlightbecause I'm multiplying 4 by 4 matrix by vector 4 by 1.So the resulting output would be 4 by 1 vector,and this would be our vector of x's.So I will use the following function, so mmult.So this is a multiplication function that multipliestwo arrays of two matrices.So select the first one, comma, and I will select vector b.And now, I will also--so I will hold Shift and Control.And then, I will hit Enter.And so this is the answer.So I'm going to highlight it in yellow.And you will see that this is exactly the numbers that we'vehad before when we were solving this system of equationsby hand.So again, we're taking long positions in bonds A, B, and Cand we're shorting.We're selling bond D. So this is howyou solve the system of equations in Excel.So overall, what we've learned in this questionis that we have learned how to tackle this type of arbitrageproblems.So all we have to do is that we'llhave to assume that we're taking long positionsin the instruments that we have.So here we have 4.If we had 10, we would assume that weare taking xa, xb, and so forth positionsin all of the 10 instruments.And then, the keys to construct the payoffs that we get--$100 in year 0--and we get $0 payoffs in all of the subsequent years.And then, what we have to do is that wehave to solve the system of equations,as we've just done here.And this way, we would know which positionsand which bonds to take in order to constructa profitable trading strategy.

#### 415-1x_Rec 04_Q3-en

PROFESSOR: In this question, I will teach youhow to find the price of a bond from a givenyield to maturity, or YTM.Let's consider the following bond.It has five years until maturity.It has face value of $100.The coupon rate is 4.5%, and this bond pays annual coupons.And the yield to maturity on this bond right now is 3.15%.So given this information, the goalis to find the price of this bond.Now, if we're given YTM on any given bond, to find its price,all we have to do is we have to take all of the cash flowsthat this bond produces and discount them to presentusing yield to maturity.And this is exactly what I will do in this question.So here, I have the cash flows that weget from holding this bond.I draw a timeline this way, and so the first paymentsin year one--or precisely at the end of year one-- we get is $4.50.This is the coupon rate multipliedby the face value of this bond, so $100 times 4.5%.This is $4.50.This is how much this bond pays to us at the end of year one.At the end of year two, we get exactly the same payments,so $4.50--at the end of year three, third coupon, same exact dollarvalue--at the end of year four, another $4.50.Now, at the end of year five, we'll get our last coupon,$4.50, plus we get the face value, $100,paid to us when this bond matures at the end of yearfive.Now, we're taking all of these cash flows from this bondand we're discounting them to present using YTM.In this equation, it is represented by letter y.So the first payment we're discountingto present by 1 plus y.The second one, because it occurs at the end of year two,is 1 plus y squared, 1 plus y raised to the power of 3,and so forth.The very last payment--1 plus y raised to the power of 5.So the only thing we have to do hereis that we have to plug in this YTM,or this y, which is 3.15% into this equationand find each of these individual ratios, add them up,and this will give us the price of this bond.Now, what I have done here is I've plugged in this yinto this equation and computed the bond price.So the bond price is $106.16.So this is how we find the bond pricefrom given yield to maturity.In the next question, what I will teachyou is I will give you the bonds with a given bond priceand I will ask you to do the converse calculation.So from given price, we will learn how to compute yieldto maturity on a given bond.Now, let's discuss very important irregularity here.So notice the relationship between the facevalue of these bonds, which is $100,and its price, which is $106.The price is higher than the face value.In this question, this happens because the coupon rateon this bond, 4.5%, is higher than the yieldto maturity, which is 3.15%.In this case, we are saying that this bondis priced at a premium because coupon rate is higherthan the yield to maturity.If the yield to maturity was the same as the coupon rate,so let's say that yield to maturity in this questionis 4.5%.We will find that the price of this bondequals to $100, in which case, we say that this bond is pricedat par.Now, conversely, if yield to maturityhere was higher than the coupon rate of 4.5%, whatwe would have found in this questionis that the bond price would be less than the facevalue of this bond.So it would be less than $100, in which case, wesay that these bonds would have been priced at a discount.This happens, again, when the coupon rateis lower than the yield to maturity on this bond.

#### 415-1x_Rec 04_Q4-en

PROFESSOR: In this question, I will teach youhow to find yield to maturity.Consider the following three-year bond.It pays annual coupon.It has face value of $100.And the coupon rate of 5.25%.The current spot interest rates are as follows.The one year rate is 1.1%.The two-year rate is 1.15%.And the three-year rate is 1.50%.We will compute yield to maturity on this bond.The first step in solving this questionis to find the price of the bond.Now we know how to find the price of the bondsso we're just taking the term structure of interest ratesthat we're given and we're discountingeach of the payments that we're getting from the bondto present using the term structure of interest rates.So first, we are taking the first coupon.So it's $5.25 so recall that this bond pays 5.25% percentcoupon.And so at the end of year one, we get $5.25.At the end of year two, we get another $5.25.At the end of year three, we get the last coupon again $5.25.And at the same time, we get the face value paymentfrom the bond.That's another 100.And so we're discounting each of these payments usingthe corresponding spot rates to present.And this gives us the price of the bond of $110.98.Now the second step is to write down the following equation.So this is definition of yield to maturity.Yield to maturity is the interest ratethat if we're using it to discount all of the cash flowsthat we get from the bond, we getthe current price of the bond.So therefore, we can write down the following question.So 110.98-- this is the current price of this bond--equals to the first coupon discountedto present at YTM, the second coupon discountedto present at YTM, plus the last coupon and the face valuediscounted to present at the YTM as well.So now all we have to do is that wehave solve this equation for y.So this is just one equation with one unknown.The only problem here is that this equation looks non-linear.So in principle, this is a cubic equation.So we have to use a lot of effortto actually solve this equation for y.So I'm going to show you how to do this in Excel.You can also use your calculatorsor any other software that solves non-linear equations.I will show you two different functionsthat we can use to find yield to maturity in Excel.What I have done in the spreadsheetis I have entered basic information about our bond.So this face value of $100, the coupon rate of 5.25%, and theseare these spot interest rates whichwe used to find the current price of the bond.So now here, I will use the rate function.So if you start adding rate, you willsee that this function requires a certain number of inputs.And these are the inputs that I've put here on top.So the first input would be the numberof periods, which in the bond speak istime to maturity of the bond.So it has three years to maturityand so therefore it makes three payments.So this will be our first input.The second input would be the periodic paymentthat our bond makes.So in our case this is annual coupon rate, which is $5.25.So this is the second input into this rate function.The third input is the present value or the current priceof the bond.Note that it is important to enter the price of the bondwith a negative sign.So here I have negative 110.98.So this is my second input.This is my third input.So the price of the bond again, it is negative.And the last input is the face value.So this is our terminal payment that weget from this instrument at the end of year three.So you could see how this function is structured.So it has the current present value, which is negative.It has a terminal payment which is the future or facevalue which is positive.It has periodic payments.This is the second argument in this functionwhich is positive.And then the first one is the number of periods.So if we close this and we hit Enter,this gives us a yield to maturityon this bond, which is 1.48%.Now the second way of solving this equationis to use internal rate of return function.So here what I've done is that I'mshowing the cash flows that we get from this bond.So again, in year zero, we have negative 110.98.So this is the price of the bond.So if we are a buyer of this bond,so this is our negative cash outflow in year zero.And then we have positive 5.25, positive 5.25,and positive 105.25.So another way of computing yield to maturityis just simply to use Internal Rate of Return function IRRand then just entering the array of our cash flows.And simply hitting Enter.This will give us the identical answer.So the yield to maturity on this bond is 1.48%.Now we do not know what internal rate of return is yet.We will learn this concept later in the course.But the yield to maturity on the bondis, in fact, the internal rate of returnif you think of this bond as your investment.So therefore, we can use both rate function and internal rateof return.You could see that the internal rate of return functionis actually much easier to use because all you have to dois that you have to enter the area of cash flowsthat you get from this bond.But we can use either of the two functionsto find the yield to maturity in Excel.

PROFESSOR: In this question, we willlearn how to compute duration for different types of bonds.Assume that the yield curve is flat at 2%.Compute the Macaulay duration and modified durationfor the following bonds.Bond A is a zero-coupon $100 face valuebond maturing in 20 years.Bond B is a 5% coupon, $100 face value perpetual bond.We will assume that the coupons are paid annually.And C is a 5% coupon bond with $100 facevalue maturing in 20 years.We will also assume that the coupons are paid annually.Let's start with question a.And compute the duration for a zero coupon bondthat matures in 20 years.Let's start with Macaulay duration.So by definition, Macaulay durationis given by the following expression.So it's 1 divided by the price of the bond multipliedby the sum where we take each of cashflows that the bond pays in year, in years T and divide itby 1 plus yield raised to the power of t multipliedby the period in which this cash flow was paid, so year t.For zero-coupon bond, all of the cashflows except for the very terminal cash flows are zero.So in this case, cash flows in year small t,where small t is equal or less than capital T wouldbe zero and cash flow in year cap T is $100.So therefore, the Macaulay duration expression,the whole sum, would be just consisting of one term.This is the terminal term.So we get 1 over P multiplied by $100 dividedby 1 plus yield raised to the power of capital T multipliedby capital T. So this is the terminal yearin which the only payment that this bond pays actually occurs.So now, notice that the price of the bond for a zero-coupon bondis given by just simply $100 divided by 1 plus yield raisedto the power of capital T. And so what I will do right nowis that I will plug in this price equationinto the duration equation.And so you could see that, that would justequal to 1 over P multiplied by P and multiplied by capital T.And so that would just give us capital T.So therefore for a zero-coupon bond,the Macaulay duration would alwaysequal to the maturity of the bond.And this is a very important property for zero-coupon bonds.So in this particular case, since our bondhas 20 years to maturity, the Macaulay durationfor this bond in part A of this question equals to 20 years.Now the next step is to find the modified duration, whichby definition is the Macaulay duration dividedby 1 plus y, which is again yield to maturity on this bond.The modified duration of this bondthen is given simply by taking 20, which is the Macaulayduration, divided by 1 plus 2%.And this gives us 19.61%.So to summarize, the Macaulay durationfor this bond is 20 and the modified duration is 19.61%.

#### 415-1x_Rec 04_Q5, Part B-en

PROFESSOR: In part b, we are given a perpetual bond.So this bond pays 5% coupon, and it has $100 face value.Coupons are paid annually.If you were to measure the stream of cash flowsthat you get from this bond, it is $5 paid annuallyand it's in perpetuity.So we will start this question by deriving modified duration.And then, we'll come back to Macaulay duration.You will see, because this would be the easiestto actually derive the modified duration first, and thengo back to Macaulay duration.So by definition, modified durationis negative 1 over P multiplied by the derivative of the bondprice with respect to yield to maturity, y.The price of perpetual bond that pays coupon Cannually is given by this because, again, this is justa simple perpetuity with a discount rate of ythat pays C, which is the annual coupon payment, every year.And as we've learned in lecture three,the present value of this perpetuityis simply C divided by y.Now, what we will do is we will firstfind the derivative of the price of the bond with respect to y.And this is very simply just negative C divided by ysquared.Because, again, the price of the bond was just C divided by y.And now, we can plug this back into the modified durationequation.And this is going to give us minus 1over P multiplied by minus C divided by y squared.And so you could see that C cancels out.y in the numerator and denominator-- one of themcancels out, and so what is left is just 1 over y.So therefore, the modified duration for a perpetual bondis simply just 1 divided by y.In our case, yield to maturities are 2% this bond.And so therefore, the modified durationof this perpetual bond that is given in this questionis just 50.Notice that it doesn't matter whatcoupon rate the perpetual bond actually pays.So the only thing that modified duration depends onis just the yield to maturity of the bond.Now, the Macaulay duration, we cancompute based on the modified duration that we just computed.Remember that duration of the Macaulay durationis just modified duration multiplied by 1 plus y.And we know that the modified duration is 1 over y.So therefore, the Macaulay duration is just 1plus y divided by y.And so therefore, in our case, given that y is 2%,the Macaulay duration will be just 1 plus 2% divided by 2%.And that's going to be 51.So therefore, to summarize this questionis that for this perpetual bond, giventhat yield to maturity in this bond is 2%,its Macaulay duration is 51.And it's modified duration is 50.

#### 415-1x_Rec 04_Q5, Part C-en

PROFESSOR: In part c, we're askedto compute duration of a 5% coupon $100face value bond that has 20 years to maturity.Let's start with Macaulay duration.Again, this is the definition of Macaulay duration writtenfor this particular bond.So capital T here is 20.This is the number of years until the maturityof this bond.And since this bond pays annual coupon,the annual payment that we get from this bond is $5.So all we need to do here is that weneed to compute the price of this bond and compute this sum.And this will give us the Macaulay duration.So we can compute this by hand.But it's a little bit tedious because we have to--we have 20 periods.And for each of the period, we have to compute these numbers.So what I will do is that I will useExcel to illustrate how to computethe duration for this bond.In this Excel spreadsheet, I have put some basic informationabout this bond.So the current YTM is 2%.Face value is $100.Coupon rate is 5%.So this bond has 20 years to maturity.So therefore each year it pays $5 coupon up until year 20,when it pays the last final coupon of $5plus the face value of 100.So the first step that I will do hereis that I will compute the price of the bond.Because if you just look at the, again,definition of Macaulay duration, weneed to know the price of the bond to compute the duration.So I will discount each of the individual coupons and cashflows to present.Then I will add them up and this will be the price of this bond.So I'll start with the very first coupon,so I'll take this $5.And we'll divide it divided by 1 plus yieldto maturity on this bond.And I will raise it to power 1 in this case.This is when this cash flow occurs.And then I will do this for all of the 20 payments.And this is the present value of eachof these individual payments that we get from this bond.So by definition, if I add this up,so this would be the price of our bond.So the price of this bond right now is 149.05.So first notice that it does make sense.So if we compare the price of this bond relative to its facevalue, it's 149 versus 100.And it does make sense because, again,so this bond has a much higher couponrate, which is 5%, relative to its yield to maturity.So this bond should be priced at a premiumand its price should be above $100.So the fact that its 149.05 kind of passes the smelltest in the sense that this bond is indeed priced at a premium.So now the next step, we need to compute the following sum.So I've written it down in the second equationwhere cash flow in the year t divided by 1 plus yield raisedof the power of t, is just the present valueof that particular cash flow that occurs in the year t.And then, each of these present value of cash flow in year two,we have to multiply it by the yearin which this payment occurs.And then we have to add them up.So this is how we're going to findthe total value of this sum.So here is exactly what I will do.So I'll take the present value that we justcomputed for the first payment.And then we'll multiply it by the yearwhen this payment occurs.In this case, it's Year 1.So you could see that in Year 2, Iwill be taking the present value of the second paymentand multiplying them by the year.When it occurs again, this is a Year 2.And so I will do it for each of the payments.And now I will add them all up.And this would be the sum that weget in the duration expression.And now by definition, all we haveto do is to compute the Macaulay duration,I have to take this sum that they just computed and divideit by the price of the bond.And this will, by definition, be the Macaulay duration.So this is how we can use the spreadsheetto find the duration of any bond.So if you have fewer than 20 years,for example you have two years, three years,you can do it by hand.In fact, you should practice to do itby hand because exam most likely is goingto feature a question where you have to compute the durationbut obviously we're not going to askyou to compute the duration for, you know, a 20-year bondbecause this is too tedious.But certainly you can do it for a two-year or just a bondwith a shorter maturity.Now the final step here, what I will dois that I will compute the modifiedduration based on the Macaulay durationthat you just computed.And modified duration would simply be just,again, the Macaulay duration divided by 1 plus the yieldto maturity in this bond which is 2%.And this is 14.15.So the modified duration for this particular bond is 14.15.Now notice, going back to Macaulay duration,notice that this bond has 20 years to maturity.But its duration is 14.43.So remember that for bond that pays 0% coupon,Macaulay duration equals exactly the maturity of the bond.But for any bond that pays nonzero or positive couponthe Macaulay duration should be strictly lessthan the maturity of the bond.So in this case, the Macaulay durationis 14.43 which is less than 20, which again is reasonablebecause that number is less than 20.

#### 415-1x_Rec 04_Q5, Part D-en

PROFESSOR: Let's summarize this question.For a zero-coupon bond that matures in 20 years,Macaulay duration was 20.Modified duration was 19.61.For a perpetual bond, Macaulay duration was 51.Modified duration was 50.And for a coupon bond--5% coupon bond that matures in 20 years--Macaulay duration was 14.43 and modified duration was 14.15.Let's compare a and c.So one of the key things that we learned hereis that for a zero-coupon bond, the Macaulay duration equalsthe maturity of the bond.And so in that case, it was 20.Now, for the bond that also has 20 year maturitybut pays a coupon, Macaulay durationhas to be strictly less than 20.So if you compare a and c, again, chas Macaulay duration of 14.43, which is less than 20.Now, if we compare b and c--so both of these bonds pay the same coupon, but bond in chas 20 years to maturity and bond in b is a perpetual bond.And so here, of course, you see that the longerthe maturity of the bond, the higher is the Macaulayduration.So in this particular case, the Macaulay durationis 51, which is much higher than the Macaulay durationfor a 5% coupon bond that matures just in 20 years.Generally speaking, if we're comparing two bonds,both of which have the same yield to maturityand the same coupon rate, the bond that matures laterwill have higher duration.

#### 415-1x_Rec 04_Q6, Part A-en

PROFESSOR: In this question, we willlearn about interest rate risk.Suppose that you manage a pensionfund and your liabilities consist of the following threepayments.10 years from now, you have to make a payment of $40 million.In 15 years from now, you have to makeanother payment of $75 million.And in 20 years from now, you haveto make a payment of $105 million.This is an approximation how actual pension funds work.Usually pension funds have to distribute pension paymentsto a rate that is obviously more frequentlythan every five years.So this is just an approximation how a regular pensionfund works.But you will see that the tools that we'lllearn in this question can be extendedto a more realistic scenario.We will assume that the term structure of interest ratesis flat at 5%.Part A of the question asks us to use modified durationto determine what happens to the present value of liabilitiesof this pension fund when interest rates increaseby 0.2%.And in part B of the question, we'llcompute the actual change in the present value of liabilitiesof the pension fund again when interest rates increaseby 0.2%.To compute the modified duration of the liabilitiesof this pension fund, let's firststart by computing its Macaulay duration.By definition, the Macaulay durationis given by this expression.So this is the same expression as we'veseen in the previous question.So let's first compute the present valueof the liabilities of this pension fund so that's our p.So in other words, let's compute the present valueof all the future liabilities of this pension fund.So this is given by this expression.So we have to make our first payment of 40 million dollarsin the year 10.So the present value of there is 40 divided by 1 plus 5.5 is our current yield to maturity.raised to the power of 10 because this paymentoccurs in the year 10.Plus $75 million dollars.This is our second payment that occurs in year 15.And finally $105 million is our last and third paymentthat occurs in year 20.So we're discounting it to present againat 5% interest rate.And we're raising it to power 20 again because this cashflow occurs in the year 20.So this gives us the present valueor the value of the future, the present valueof the future liabilities of this pension fundwhich is $100.21 million.Now the Macaulay duration, again,is given by this equation.So we've computed p, the price.So now we can compute the remaining term.So this sum term, which here consists of just threeturns because we have three liability payments.So 1 divided by 100.21, this is onedivided by the price or the present valueof our liabilities multiplied by 40 divided by 1plus 5% raised to the power of 10,so this is the present value of the first liabilitypayment multiplied by 10.So this is the year when this payment occurs.Plus 75 divided by 1 plus 5% raised to the power of 15,again this is the present value of the second paymentmultiplied by 15.This is the year when it occurs.Plus 105 or divided by 5% raised to the power of 20 times 20.Because that payment occurs in the year 20.So when we compute this, the Macaulay durationof our liabilities is 15.75 years.Now the modified duration by definitionis just Macaulay duration divided by 1 plus yield.So in our case, this would be 15.75 divided by 1 plus 5%.And this will give us exactly 15.So the modified duration of our liabilities of this pensionfund is just 15.Now what we want to do right now isthat we want to use this modified durationto approximate the change in value of our liabilitieswhen a yield curve shifts.So to be precise technically speaking,when is it going to be a parallel shift in the yieldcurve.The value, the change in the value of our liabilities,can be approximated using the following equation.So the change in the value, this isdelta P would equal to the original valueof our liabilities times the modified durationtimes the change in the yield.And this goes with the negative sign because the value--the price of the bond or the value of the bond and yieldschange in the opposite direction.So if yields increase the value of bonds will decrease.And so this is what will happen in our case.So now let's use the numbers that we have in this questionso the assumption is that the yield curve shifts up by 0.2%.So therefore the value of our holdingswill change by this much.So we are taking the original $121 million,we're multiplying it by the modified duration which is 15.And we're multiplying it by the changein the yield, which is 0.2%.And this gives us negative $3 million.So as yield increases by 0.2%, the value of our liabilitiesdrops by 3 million dollars.And this answer is given to us by using this approximationin which we're using the modified duration to computethe approximate change in the value of our liabilities.

#### 415-1x_Rec 04_Q6, Part B-en

PROFESSOR: Let's compute the actual changein value of our liabilities.So the new yield curve right now is flat at 5.2%.So all we need to do here is that weneed to take this new yield and computethe current present value of the liabilities of this pensionfund.So this is the same expression as we had before,when the yield curve was at 5%.So right now, the only differencehere is that we're using the new yield of 5.2%.If we compute this present value of liabilities,we will find that the value is $97.25 million.So therefore, the actual decrease in valueis what it was before.And before, the value was $100.21 million.And the current value is $97.25.So the actual decrease in value is $2.96 million.This is by how much the present value of our liabilitiesdropped as a result of the increase in the yield,or, again, the parallel shift in the yield curve.So let's summarize.When we used the modified durationand we found the approximate changein the value of our liabilities, the answerwas that it decreased by $3 million.Now, when we compute the actual decrease,the actual decrease was $2.96 million.So it's actually less than what was approximatedby the modified duration.Now, the first thing to note hereis that apparently, modified duration actually workedreally well to give us the approximate change in the valueof our liabilities.So the only difference here is $0.04 million.But now, let's start to understandwhy the actual value decreases less than what durationapproximation gives us.Let's look at this chart, and the answerwill be that this is due to the convexity of the bond prices,the function of the yield.So let's look at the right part of this picture,so this is where the yield increase.So if you look at, for example, just hypothetically speakingon this picture.So let's say that the yield changed from 5% to 7%.So based on this picture, so the blue line hereis the duration approximation.By how much, if we are going to use modified duration,what would be the decrease in the value of our holdings asimplied by the duration?And the red line is the actual--is the actual price of the bond.And you could see that due to the convexity,that the actual decrease in the value of these liabilitieswould actually be lower than what it would have beenif we just used the modified durationto approximate that change.And this is precisely what we found in this question.

#### 415-1x_Rec 04_Q7, Part A-en

PROFESSOR: In this question, we willlearn how to compute bond convexityand we'll learn how to use it to approximate the changein the value of our holdings or in the value of the bond.So assume that the yield curve is flat at 3.5%.We will assume that there is $100 face valuebond that pays annual coupons and has five years to maturity.The coupon rate is 5%.So first we will compute the modified duration of this bond.Second we will compute its convexity,then we will use modified duration of this bondto try to find the approximate change in the valueof the bonds when interest rates drop or the yield curvedrops by 1.5%.This is exactly what we have done in question 6.Then we will actually use convexity,the one that we'll compute in part B of this questionto find the approximate change in the value of the bondwhen interest rates drop by the same 1.5%.And then in the last part we'll compute the actual changein the value of the bond and thenwe will compare that actual change to parts C and Dof the question and see how well both parts Cand D approximate the actual changein the value of this bond.Let's start by computing the modified duration of this bond.So this is very similar to what we have done in question 5and the spreadsheet has the same template.The only difference is that this bondhas five years to maturity.So the YTM on this bond, the current YTM, is 3.5%,its face value is $100 and this bond pays 5% annual coupon.So here we have the cash flows that we get from this bondand the first step what I will dois that I need to compute its price.So I will compute the present value of this cash flow.So we've already done this calculation several times.And so if I compute present value for each of these fivepayments, I add them up.This will be the price of the bond.Again, I always recommend making sure that the price of the bondmakes sense.So in this case, we expect this bond to be priced at a premiumbecause the coupon rate of this bond is higher than its yieldto maturity.And so the price of the bond, 106is above the face value of $100, so this makes sense.So now the next step I will compute the present valueof each of these individual paymentsand multiply it by the year in which it occurs.I will add them up as well.And then I will compute the Macaulay durationby taking the sum and dividing by the price of the bond.And so this would be the Mcaulay duration of this bond.So it's 4.56%.Again, recall the other check is that we expect the Mcaulayduration here because this is a coupon paying bond,we expect the Mcaulay duration to be lowerthan the maturity of the bond.So the maturity of this bond is five years,the Mcaulay duration is 4.56.And finally, the modified durationis just the Macaulay duration dividedby 1 plus the current yield.So the answer here will be that the modified duration is 4.41.

#### 415-1x_Rec 04_Q7, Part B-en

PROFESSOR: Let's compute convexity of this bond.I will start with definition.So convexity of the bond is givenby 1/2 multiplied by the inverse price, multipliedby the second derivative of the bond price with respect to YTM.So what I'm going to do right now,I will try to expand this formulaby taking the second derivative of the bond pricewith respect to YTM.So let's write down the bond price as this.So this is just the present value of cash flowsthat we get from the bond discountat the present at its YTM.I will take the first derivative,which would be given by the following expression.Now we'll take the second derivative, which wouldbe given by this expression.I will write it down slightly differentlyby factoring out 1 over 1 plus YTM squared.So that under the summation sign wewill get the following expression.And now I will plug in this derivativeinto the definition of the convexity.And so I'm going to get 1/2 multipliedby the inverse price, multiplied by 1 over 1 plus yield squared,multiplied by the following sum.Within this following sum, what Iwill do is that I will write downthe ratio of cash flow received in the year t,divided by 1 plus YTM, raised to the power tas the present value of this cash flow.So this is why I factored out 1 plus y squared,so that I can actually write downthis as the present value of this cash flow.And so therefore under this summation sign,we're going to have the present value of cash flow in the yeart multiplied by year t multiplied by year t plus 1.And so this is the expression that wecan use right now to compute the convexity of the bondthat we have in this question.This is a similar spreadsheet that wehad in part A of this question.So here we are given our current YTM, the facevalue of the bond, the coupon, the cashflows that we get from the bond.And we've already found the priceof this bond, which was 106.77.So right now let's use this expressionwhich is derived to compute the convexity of this bond.So first, for each year 1 through 5,I will compute this expression that wehave under the summation sign.So this is the present value of eachof these cash flows multiplied by tand multiplied by t plus 1.So for year 1, I will take the present valuethat we compute it here.I will multiply it by year, 1 in this case,and multiply it by 1 plus another 1.And I will do this calculation for each of these payments.And then I will add it up.And so you can see that to compute the convexity,I need to take 1/2.I need to divide it by the price of the bond,and I need to divide it by 1 plus y squared.And so first I will take the sum of these terms.And then I will divide it by 2, Iwill multiply it by the price.And then we'll multiply it by 1 plus YTM squared.And so this would exactly be the convexity of this bond.So the convexity will be 12.38.

#### 415-1x_Rec 04_Q7, Part C-en

PROFESSOR: Now suppose that the interest ratesdrop by 1.5% at all maturities.This means that the yield curve shifted downwards by 1.5%.So first we will use the modified durationto determine first-order approximate change in this bondprice.So this is exactly what we have done in the previous question.So the change in the price of the bondis going to be negative again, negative sign because yieldsand prices go in the opposite directions.So is it going to be a negative original priceof the bond, multiplied by the modified duration,multiplied by the change in the yield.So recall that the price of this bond is 106.77.The modified duration that we computedin part A of this question is 4.41.And we're multiplying it by negative 1.5%,so this is the drop in the yield curve.So doing this calculation gives us delta P equal to $7.06.So therefore, as interest rates drop by 1.5%,the bond price increased approximately by $7.06.

#### 415-1x_Rec 04_Q7, Part D-en

PROFESSOR: Now in this question, wewill use both modified duration and convexitythat we computed in part B to determinea second-order approximate change in the bond price.The second-order approximate change in the bond priceis given by the following expression,so it's the original price, multiplied by negative modifiedduration, multiplied by the change in YTM,plus the convexity of the bond, multipliedby the change in YTM squared.So let's plug in the numbers that we have for the price,for the modified duration, and for the convexity of this bond.So the price is 106.77, the modified duration is 4.41,the YTM again drops by 1.5%, the convexitythat we computed in part B of this question is 12.38,multiplied by 1.5% squared.Computing this gives us the change in price of $7.36.So as YTM drops by 1.5%, the price of this bondincreases by approximately $7.36

#### Q7, Part E-en

PROFESSOR: Finally let us compute the actual changein the price of the bond and then we'llcompare this change with approximationsthat we obtained in part C and D of this question.So the new yield to maturity on this bond right now is 2%.So it was 3.5, dropped by 1.5, so the new YTM is 2%.So given this new YTM we can compute the bond pricewhich will be $114.14.So therefore, the actual change in the price of this bondis $114.14, minus the original priceof the bond, which is $106.77, this will give us $7.37.Now let's put this all together.So the change in value that we obtainedusing first-order approximation or approximation only usingmodified duration was $7.06.The approximation, the second-order approximationthat we obtained using both modified durationand convexity of this bond is $7.36 and the actual changein the price of this bond is $7.37.Now you can see how remarkably closethe second-order approximation isto actual change in the price of the bond.This is because the price of the bondas the function of yield to maturity is a convex function.And in this question we've given you a very large changein yield to maturity.So the original was 3.5% and it dropped by 1.5%.Recall that the first-order approximation,or the approximation using just modified durationwould work well but only for small change in yields.But for these large changes, such as drop by 1.5%,the first-order approximation doesn't work that well.It still works OK, but doesn't workas well as both modified duration and the convexityof the bond, where we can come as close as just$0.01 within the actual change in the value of this bond.

PROFESSOR: In this lecture, we'regoing to talk about the relation of stocks.We're going to start with a quick overview of equities,stocks and securities, and the markets where they trade,and then introduce the basic tools for equity valuation.Now, stocks are relatively well known financial securities.Common stocks represent equity or ownership positionsin the corporation.They allow for a distributed form of ownershipof public companies.When your own shares of a stock, let'ssay, your own shares of IBM, you effectivelyare one of the owners of the company.You may own a small fraction of the company in proportionto the number of shares, but you are one of the owners.And this is how large public companiescan be owned by large groups of investorsthrough their ownership of stocks.Stocks deliver payments to their ownersin the form of dividends, which are cash payments and sharerepurchases, which are transactionsin the market where the company buys back its own shares.These are different types of transactions.They have different properties, but the end result is the same.By paying dividends or by buying back shares,the company is able to distribute cash backto its owners, back to the shareholders.If you compare ownership of stocks to ownership of bonds,payments to the bond holders are contractual.They're fixed in the definition of the security.They're not discretionary.In contrast, payments to the stockholders are discretionary,and they're uncertain.The timing of these payments and their amountare not guaranteed, and are subject to the discretionof the management and to various types of risks,business risks to which the company isexposed, market conditions changing, and so forth.Stocks have several important basic characteristics.One is that stocks are what we call residual claims.Stockholders get paid after the company has paid its creditors.In other words, stocks are relativelyjunior in the capital structure of the firm comparedto debt obligations.The company has to repay its bonds.If there is money left after that,it can pay the stockholders.Stocks are limited liability instruments.What this means is that when you buy a share of a company,you can lose as much as the entire investment, but no morethan that.For example, if you own a fraction of a company by owningshares and the company is the subject of a lawsuit,whatever the settlement may be, you cannot lose more thanyour investment.Your own personal assets are not on the line.This is what is called limited liability.Limited liability is an important featureof many financial securities, and as you can see,it is a key to allowing for distributed ownership.Stocks also confer voting rights to their owners.Stockholders can participate in corporate governance.They can vote on important corporate events.For example, they can vote during electionsfor the board of directors.They can vote on large corporate actions,like mergers and acquisitions.They can vote on executive compensation and so forth.Day to day operations of the firm are run by the management.Firm owners, the shareholders, are notinvolved in these tactical decisions,but they can be involved in strategic actions,such as mergers and acquisitions.And they can participate by voting.How exactly the votes are distributed in relationto share ownership depends.It varies firms to firm, but typically, itis one share, one vote.The more shares you own, the more votes you control.When we think about trading of stocks,we can conceptually think about two typesof markets, the primary market and the secondary market.The primary market transaction isa transaction between the firm and its investors shareholders.For example, if it's a relatively young firm,it doesn't trade in the public markets.It is raising money from investors.For instance, it may be raising moneyfrom a venture capital firm.It engages in a primary market transaction.It would issue shares and sell them to a VC companyto raise capital.At a later stage as the firm matures,it may get listed for public trading,and then it would sell its shares to the broadergroup of investors.This event is called an initial public offering, the IPO.That's when the shares of the firmget listed on one of the standard exchanges.This is also a primary market transaction.The company is selling shares to its investors.At a later stage in the lifecycle, the firm,the company can raise more capitalfrom investors in the form of equity.It may sell additional shares.This is called a secondary equity offering, an SEO.Again, it's a transaction between the firmand its investors.These types of transactions when the firm is raising moneyfrom investors are typically facilitatedby financial intermediaries, like investment banks.They help to make sure that this process goes smoothly,the firm is able to raise the desired amount of capital,and the shares go into the hands of the right typesof investors.These transactions are called underwriting.When we think about the secondary market,this is the market where shares get traded between investors.This market does not involve the firm itself.This is a resale market.This is what most of the investors are familiar with,and this is where most of the trading takes place.By now, there are many competing exchangeswhere trading takes place, as well asadditional trading venues.Some of the best known exchanges and those controllingthe largest percentage of the trading volume in the UnitedStates and globally are NYSE, New York Stock Exchange, CBOE,the Chicago Board of Options Exchange, and NASDAQ.These exchanges are regulated by the SEC.They are subject to regulatory oversight,and they have to maintain certain standardsand provide investor protection.There are also other ways to buy and sell securities.These are called, broadly, alternative trading systems.These include electronic communication networks,which provide trading venues outside of the exchanges.They include dark pools and so forth.These types of trading venues are not exchanges.They're not subject to the exact same regulations.They still are subject to regulatory oversight,but the rules are different.They typically register them as broker dealers,and they're not required to providethe same level of transparency, for example, as exchanges do.They also tend to operate during other hourswhen exchange may be closed, alternative training venueswould be open, and they generallyhave different economic trade offs, different cost structure.A significant fraction of tradingnowadays goes through these alternative trading venues.As you can see from the graph, as youlook at the distribution of tradingacross the largest exchanges, the stock marketnowadays is highly fragmented.There are many competing players, and none of themdominates the market in terms of the trading volume.There are several leading exchanges.Some of them are owned by the NYSE group.Some are owned by CBOE.They may conduct 5%, 10% of the daily volume of trade,on average, in various securities, but none of themcontrol the majority of trading in the equity market.Over time, the volume of trading has been rising.If you look over the 30 year period from 1984 until now,the overall volume of trading on the New York Stock Exchangeincreased almost tenfold.Part of this increase can be explained by the factthat the overall market is growing,and that can be seen from the rising level of the stockmarket index.That's not the whole story.However, trading nowadays is largely electronic,and the volume of trading has been rising sharplyover the last two decades.And this partly reflects the rise of high frequency tradingstrategies, which accounts for a significant fraction of tradingvolume in equity markets.

PROFESSOR: Next, we consider multi-stage growth models.The Gordon model, the constant growth model,is a useful approximation.It's also a useful building blockfor constructing more realistic models.But of course, the assumption of constant growthforever is typically not a good approximationto how real firms behave.It is more realistic to think of the companyas going through different stages of growththroughout its lifecycle.When the firm is young, it may start small and grow rapidlyby capturing an increasing market share.Over time, as the company grows larger and larger,it's going to be harder to maintain the same growth rate.There may be some initial competitive advantagesthat the firm has.Over time, competition is going to catch up.Also, as the company gets large in terms of its market share,increasing the market share further is going to becomeprogressively difficult. So in the long run,we cannot expect large, established firms to growat the same rate as young growth firms.The way to model this is to assumethat in the early stages, the company maygo through a so-called growth stagewith a relatively high growth rate, which will eventuallyslow down.And long term, the company is goingto reach maturity, at which pointthe growth rate is going to be relatively lowand is going to converge to some kind of averagefor the same type of firms, perhaps average for the sector.Now, let's consider an example.Northern Company is expected to pay $1 per share in dividendsnext year.This number is expected to grow at a 10% rate for the next 5years.After that, the growth rate of the companyis going to slow down.And it's going to be 2% from that point on, forever.The cost of capital of this company,or the discount rate on its cash flows, is 8%.The question is, what is the current shareprice of the Northern Company?The following table projects dividends per sharefor this firm over the next several years.You can see that at time 1, the dividend is expected to be $1.And this is going to grow at a 10% rate.So it's going to be 1.1 in year 2, 1.21 in the year 3,and so forth, until we hit year 6.And after that, the growth rate is going to slow down to 2%.We are going to value this stock by dividingthe timeline into two portions.The first segment is going to be from year 0 up toand including year 6.The second segment is going to start in year 7and go all the way to infinity.We are going to price these two portions of cash flowseparately.So let's start with the residual piece, whichis D7, D8, and so forth.We are going to compute the price of this residual segmentfrom the point of view of time 6.From the perspective of time 6, what we're dealing withis a Gordon model.The growth rate of the company starting from P at 7is constant.We can therefore apply the Gordon formula.The price of the stock at time 6 isequal to D7, the expected cash flow at time 7, whichis 1.64 divided by r, the discount rate, minus g,the growth rate, which at that point is 2%.So 1.64 divided by 8% minus 2% is $27.38.That is the residual value of the stock at time 6, P6.Now, we can use our DCF formula at time 0.The price of the stock at time 0 is equal to the sum,from 1 to 6, of the dividends discountedat the 8% rate, which is the expected return,plus the residual term P6 discountedat the same 8% rate over 6 years.When we compute the sum, the end result is $23.07.And that is the value of the firmunder this two-stage growth assumption.

PROFESSOR: We now know how to price equities in relationto their future dividends and discount rates.Expected future dividends are an important inputinto equity pricing.Forecasting dividends is a complex problem.Our approach here is to relate dividends of the firmto other fundamentals.In particular, we are going to relate firm's dividendsto its profits.For simplicity, we assume that the firmis all equity financed.It does not have debt and makes no interest payments.We start with firm's profits, its earnings per share,which we define net of depreciation and taxes.Dividends are related to earnings by the payout ratio.The payout ratio is simply a ratio of dividends per shareto earnings per share.This ratio tells us what fraction of firm's earningsis paid out to its investors.The remaining profits are reinvested into the firm.Algebraically, dividends per shareare equal to earnings per share times the payout ratio.Next, we think about how to forecast earnings.The key input into the forecast is retained earnings.Retained earnings are equal to the difference between earningsand dividends and represent the portion of the firm's cashflows reinvested into the business.The fraction of the earnings retained by the firmis called the plowback ratio.It is the ratio of retained to total earningsand is equal to 1 minus the payout ratio.For example, if a firm generates $2.00 per share in earningsand pays out $0.80 to its investors,then the payout ratio is 40% and the plowback ratio is 60%,with $1.20 reinvested into the firm.We should note, as an aside, that by accumulatingretained earnings over time, we cankeep track of the firm's book value of equity, whichis an accounting measure of firm value.Unlike the market value of equity,which is a forward looking measure of firm value,the book value is backward lookingand is simply a summary of the history of firm's investments.Firms' investments generate incremental cash flowsin the future.We assume, for simplicity, that an investment at time tgenerates a constant, perpetual stream of additional cash flowsstarting from the next period, t plus 1.We will also assume that, without additional investments,firms expect that future earnings remain constant.We make both of these assumptions for simplicityin order to focus on the conceptual elementsof this analysis.One can replace these assumptionswith a more realistic and complex model of how investmentgenerates incremental earnings.Consider the following example.A company, Texas Western, or TW, is expected to earn $1.00 pershare next year.The firm plans an expansion to increase its earningsby 8% per year.Without these additional investments, earnings of TWare expected to remain constant forever.Each additional dollar of investment generatesincremental perpetual cash flow of $0.10 startingin the following period.We assume that all new investment isfinanced by retained earnings.The discount rate is 10%.We assume that this discount rate applies to all future cashflows of the firm.Our task is to determine the price of TW shares and the twoalternative growth strategies.In the first case, TW pays out all of its earningsforever and does not invest.In the second case, TW expands and grows its earnings foreverat 8% per year.We start with the case of no investment.In this case, the firm pays out 100% of its earnings.Without investment, earnings of TW remain at the same expectedlevel of $1.00 per share forever.Because the payout ratio is 100%,dividends per share are also expected to be $1.00 forever.Applying the 10% discount rate to future dividends, we find,using the perpetuity formula, that the initial priceof the stock is $10.00 per share.Next consider the case of perpetual growth.TW aims to grow its earnings at the rate of 8% per year.The first question we must answer is, at what rateshould TW reinvest its earnings to achievethe 8% rate of growth?In other words, we want to determine the required plowbackratio.Suppose that, at time t, TW invests fractionb of its earnings.This investment raises all future earningsby 10% of the total amount invested,which is the plowback ratio times its earnings in period t.As a result, earnings per share at time t plus 1are equal to the EPS in the previous period times 1plus 0.1 times the plowback ratio.We conclude that to achieve an 8% growth rate,the firm must use the plowback ratio of 80%.The payout rate must then equal 20%.Under the permanent expansion at the 8% rate,dividends per share in the first year are expected to be $0.20,which is 20% of the expected earnings.Using the constant growth model, the initial priceof the stock of TW is equal to the expected dividend,next period, divided by the difference between the discountrate and the expected dividend growth rate.The initial stock price is then $10.00 per share.The price of the stock is the same as in the no growthscenario.Why are the two values the same?The reason is firm's future investmentsdo not add anything to the firm value.Each time TW invests $1.00, it generates a perpetual cash flowstream of $0.10, starting a period later.The NPV of this investment with the discount rate of 10% is 0.As we will learn in the following section,this means that TW has no growth opportunities.Because our assumptions imply that all new investments are0 NPV, the value of TW does not depend on its growth strategy.

PROFESSOR: In this segment, we willlearn how to think about growth opportunities,how to value them, and how much opportunities for future growthcontribute to the price of the stock.First, define what the growth opportunities are.Growth opportunities are future investment opportunitiesthat generate a positive NPV.Such investment opportunities contribute positivelyto the firm value.Stocks of companies with access to future growth opportunitiesare considered growth stocks.The term growth stock is used casuallyto refer to firms which would notbe called growth stocks under our formal definition.For example, a firm with growing salesis not necessarily investing at a positive NPV,as we have seen in our example of Texas Western.Same goes for the firms with growing assets or growingdividends.The bottom line-- a growth firm isa firm able to make positive NPV investments in the future.Our objective is to figure out how to value such growthopportunities.Consider the following example.Expected earnings per share of ABC Softwarewill be $8.33 next year.ABC will pay out 60% of its earnings as dividends forever.Assume that new investments will generatea perpetual expected cash flow stream of $0.25for each dollar invested.The discount rate for all cash flows is 15%.We need to figure out what portion of firm valuereflects the value of its growth opportunities.To do that, we compute the price of the stockin two different ways--with and without growth.We define the present value of growth opportunities, or PVGO,as the difference between the actual stock priceand the price that would apply without growth,which would correspond to 100% payout and no investment.We first compute the stock price with growth.The expected dividend per share in the first yearis 60% of expected earnings, which is $5.Under the parameters of the problem,both earnings and dividends of the firmare expected to grow at the 10% rate.To see this, compute the expected earningsin the second period.Investment in the first period is 40% of the firm's earnings,or $3.33 per share.Each dollar investment raises future earnings by $0.25.So the first period investment raises second period earningsby $0.83 relative to the first period.This implies a 10% growth rate.The same argument applies to all future periods.So both earnings and dividends areexpected to grow at the 10% rate forever.The price of the stock is given by the constant growth formula.Stock price at time 0 equals the expected dividendin the first period divided by the differencebetween the discount rate and the dividend growth rate.This means that the initial stock price is $100 per share.Under the no growth policy, the firmpays out all of its earnings as dividends.In this case, dividends in the first periodare $8.33 per share.The value of the stock is given by the constant growth formula.Without growth, this is simply the expected dividendnext period over the discount rate,which equals $55.56 per share.The difference between the stock price with and without growthis $44.44.This represents the present valueof growth opportunities of ABC.Next, we take a closer look at how future investments of ABCadd to the firm value.At time 1, ABC invests 40% of its earnings, whichequals the $3.33 per share.With each dollar producing $0.25 in addition of future earnings,the time 1 investment generates additional expected earningsof $0.83 in all future periods, starting with period two.The NPV of the time 1 investment is the present valueof the perpetual stream of $0.83 per year.Net of the initial investment of $3.33, which adds up to $2.22.At time 2, the same logic applies.Because the magnitude of the firm's investment rises by 10%,all resulting cash flows grow by 10% as well.And so does the NPV of its investment.We conclude that the NPV of the time 2 investmentis 10% higher than the NPV of the time 1 investmentand equals $2.44.Applying the same valuation process to all future years,we find that firm investments generate a stream of NPVsgrowing at 10% per year.The total present value of ABC's future investmentis then given by the constant growth formula.The initial cash flow is the NPV of the time 1 investment.The discount rate is 15%, and the growth rate is 10%.This implies the present value of growth opportunitiesof $44.44 per share, which is the same value we uncoveredby comparing the price of the stock with and without growth.

PROFESSOR: We started this week by observingthat valuation ratios seem to be systematicallydifferent across different types of firms.Financials and automakers are tradingat different valuation ratios, or different P/E ratios.We can now see that one reason whyfirms may trade at different P/E ratiosis because of differences in their growth opportunities.Let's take a closer look.Suppose that the ROE of the firm is constant over time.The price of the stock has two components.One component represents the value of the firmwithout growth and the second componentreflects the value of future growth opportunities, PVGO.The value of the firm without growthis given by the expected earningsat time 1, which are going to continuein perpetuity without growth, divided by the cost of capitalR. The present value of growth opportunitiesis the discounted value of the NPV of future investmentsthat the firm makes.Now let's define the P/E ratio formula.The P/E ratio under our definitionis the ratio of the price of the stock at time 0 to the expectedearnings at time 1.Our definition is different from the common definition usedin the business media, where the price of the stock at time 0is divided by the lagged earnings, whichare also measured at time 0.Now let's use our formula.The price of the stock is equal to the expected earningsdivided by the cost of capital plus the present valueof growth opportunities.Suppose that the firm does not have any growth opportunities.PVGO is 0.In this case, the P/E ratio is equal to 1 over r,1 over the cost of capital.If the present value of growth opportunities is positive,the P/E ratio is equal to 1 over r plus the ratio of PVGO,the earnings at time 1, or specifically expected earningsat time 1.What we see is that for the firm with higher present valueof growth opportunities, the P/E ratiois higher, which means that P/E ratio reflectshow rich the firm is in growth opportunities.This is one of the reasons why we observe different valuationratios, different price to earnings ratios,across different industries and across different typesof firms.This reflects different growth prospectsthat these firms are facing.

PROFESSOR: So far, we talked about the valuation of stocks.But the same techniques can be usedto value the entire business.We don't need to be focusing just on equities.So let's start with the discounted cash flow formula.The present value of the businessis equal to the discounted expected value of the free cashflows that the business generatesbetween time 1 and time capital T plus the present valueof the remaining cash flows, which we call PV capitalT discounted back to time zero.What you see here is that we are splitting the timelineinto two portions.We're discounting cash flows between time 1 and time capitalT separately.And then we are discounting the residual,which we call the horizon value a time capital T.We are focusing on the free cash flows, whichis net cash flows that can be attributed to the businessthat we are evaluating.In order to apply this formula, weneed to forecast cash flows from time 1 to time capital T.And we need to predict the horizon value, PV capital T.In our previous analysis, we focusedon the forecasting of payouts, dividends, or in this case,we can use the same techniques for free cash flows.What we now need to do is figure outhow to predict the horizon value PV capitalT. This is the focus of our current discussion.There are several alternative methodsthat one could use to forecast the horizon value.We are going to look at three alternatives.The first method uses P/E multiples.What this means is that we are goingto forecast the profits that this business generates at timecapital T. And then scale them by the P/E multiple, whichis a typical price-to-earnings ratio that is applied to stocksthat we view as comparable to the businessthat we're evaluating.The second approach is similar in nature.We're also using comparables.We're also looking for the valuationratios of similar firms, similar traded businesses.But instead of the P/E ratio, we'reusing the price-to-book ratio, whichis the ratio of the market price of equity to its book value.The last approach is what we call the DCF approach.In this case, we do not use valuation multiples.We are determining the horizon value using the discounted cashflow formula by making particular assumptionsabout future growth of the business after time capital T.Now, what is the logic behind using multipliersversus the DCF approach?The multiplier approach is a particular typeof relative valuation.It is a relative valuation approachwhere we are looking for companiesthat are similar to the firm under consideration.And we're asking how much the marketis paying for those businesses in relationto either their book value or the profitsthat they're generating.The challenge with using this approachis that businesses generally are not the same.It is not easy to find two firms thatare very close comparables.What we're doing here is a hybrid approach,where we are forecasting cash flowsover the first several periods explicitly.And we're discounting them.And then we're applying the multiples approachat time capital T.The logic of this is that even though itmay be quite difficult to find very good comparable firmsat time zero, this gets progressively easier as weare looking into the future.And the reason for that is that theretends to be a certain degree of convergencebetween different types of firms in expectation.So the firms that look very different at time zeroin expectation look less different.And therefore, the multiples approachbecomes more and more accurate.Now, one can say that the multiples approach is nota pure fundamental approach to valuation because ratherthan discounting cash flows, we're using multiples.At the end of the day, the DCF formula,the multiples approach, are different versionsof relative valuation.If we want to use a pure DCF approach,we're going to make assumptions about future growthof the firm.For example, if we assume that beyond certain horizonthe firm exhausts its growth opportunities, for instance,competition catches up.And the firm can no longer make positive NPV investments.We can figure out what the horizon value is.It is going to be equal to the free cash flow at time capitalT plus 1 under the no-growth assumption discountedas a perpetuity without growth.So it's free cash flow time t plus 1divided by the opportunity cost of capital.Consider the following example or the data given in the table.We have a business here, which startswith the asset value of 5.Think of it as 5 million.And it grows over time.For each period, from 1 to six, wecan see how the asset value evolves.How this business generates earnings.And we can see net investment.That investment is the investment into the businessin the form of CAPX, capital expenditure,net of depreciation.Earnings here are also measured net of depreciation.Now, the free cash flow that this business generatesis equal to earnings minus its net investment.This is the cash flow that is left after the firm reinvestsback into the business.We make an assumption about the discount rate.The discount rate is constant at 15%.And therefore, we can compute the discount factor,which is then applied to cash flows in different periods.This is given at the bottom of the table.In our example, the company is goingthrough two stages of growth.In the first few years, growth rate is relatively high.And the firm is reinvesting a lot back into the business.And therefore, the free cash flow may in fact be negative.This does not mean that the firm is losing money.It simply means that the firm is investing morethan the cash it is generating.After the first few years, growth rateslows down and investment declines accordingly.The present value of this businesscan be computed as the present value of the free cashflows of the first several years for 1to capital T plus the present value of the horizon valueat time capital T. We will now use our threealternative approaches to estimate the present valueof the business.Let's start with the multiples approach, the P/E multiples,in particular.We are going to discount free cash flows from 1 to 4.And then apply the multiples approachto figure out the horizon value at time 4.The present value of the free cash flows from 1 to 4is minus $1.42.This reflects the fact that the firm in the early periodsis investing more than the cash flow it is generating.To estimate the horizon value, PV4,we need to apply the P multiples for comparable firmsto the expected earnings of the firm at time 5,one period forward.Expected earnings generated at time 5 are estimated at $1.75.Let's assume that the P multiple for comparable firmsis equal to six.In which case, we are going to multiply the expectedthat earnings at time 5 by a factor of sixto estimate the horizon value at time 4, PV4.The present value of this horizon value is $10.50,which is the value at time 4 discounted at the 15% rate backto time zero, which is $6.Next, let's estimate the firm value, the business value,using the price-to-book multiples.The logic is very similar to the previous calculation.Except now, instead of using the ratio of price-to-earningsfor comparable firms, we are goingto use the ratio of price-to-book, the marketvalue of equity divided by the book value.Again, we're estimating the horizon value at time 4.The book value at time 4, the value of the assets, is $11.75.And this gets scaled by the average book-to-price ratiofor comparable firms, which we assume to be equal to 1.2.As a result, our estimate of the horizon value is $14.10.And discounted back to time zero at the 15% rate,this gives us $8.06.Our final calculation uses the pure DCF approach.Under this approach, we have to establish a point in timebeyond which the firm is expected to have no remaininggrowth opportunities.For the sake of the argument, suppose that that period is Tequal to 5.From that point on, the firm is goingto produce no positive NPV.And therefore, at time 5, we comprise the horizon valueusing the no growth formula.Let's do that.Between periods 1 and 5, the free cash flows of the firm,after being discounted back to time zero,adapt to minus $0.95.The present value at time 5 can becomputed as the earnings, which is what the firm would pay outwith the no growth assumption.Discounted at the cost of capital, 15%.Because without growth, the firm wouldbe expected to pay $1.88, which is the earning set times 6in perpetuity.At the end of this, we find that the horizon value at time 5is estimated to be $12.55.And discounted back to time 0, this gives us $6.24.Notice that we are using different horizons,capital T under these alternative relationapproaches.This is just to highlight the factthat there is no reason to pick the same horizon whenwe're using the multiples approach versus DCF.The logic is not identical.Under the multiples approach, we are comparing the firmto other similar firms.We simply want to find the point in time when we thinkthis comparison is accurate.Under the pure DCF approach, we are finding a point a timebeyond which we feel comfortable forecasting firm growth.In this particular example, we are finding a point in timebeyond which the firm has no remaining growth opportunities.And therefore, the value of the firmcan be computed under the no growth assumption.We now pull together our estimates.Using the P multiples, we estimate the present valueto be $4.58.Under the price-to-book multiple approximation,we find the present value to be $6.64.And using the pure DCF approach, the value is $5.29.The solution using the P/E multiplesgives us the most conservative estimate of the firm value.Now, firm valuation is not a simple problem.And our estimates are based on a numberof simplifying assumptions.What we get from this analysis is the senseof the range of likely values.This range can be fairly wide, which iswhat our analysis illustrates.In order to apply these results, we have to look further.We have to study sensitivity of these numbersto their underlying assumptions.At the end of the day, what we findis that valuation is not a simple problem.However, we now have the tools to tackle it.

PROFESSOR: We will now develop a basic valuation modelfor equities called Discounted Cash Flow Model, or DCF Model.Let's look at the prices of several financial companies.These are large banks like J.P. Morgan, Bank of America,and so forth.In the table, you can see prices per shareas well as earnings per share and the valuation ratios,such as the price to earnings ratio of price to sales ratio.What is interesting about this isthat these firms are very different in termsof their overall size, or market cap.Some of them extremely large, like Bankof America and JP Morgan Chase, some are a lot smaller.But when we look at their valuation ratios,such as the price to earnings ratio,those ratios are fairly close to each other.What this suggests, what this pattern is telling us,is that there is something that all of these financial firmsseem to have in common as far as their valuation is concerned.The market is pricing these stocksat a similar multiple in relation to their earnings.Let's compare this to the automakers.Now we are looking at various car manufacturers, Toyota,Volkswagen, BMW, and so forth.Again, these companies are very heterogeneous in termsof their overall size.Their valuation ratios also tend to be closely relatedto each other.They are lower than those for the banks.So what is going on?Why is it that car manufacturers arepriced on average at the lower levelas a fraction of their earnings, as a P/E multiple,compared to banks?What determines valuation of different types of stocks?That's the question that we want to answer.We're going to start with very basic theoretical observations.Let's look at the present value of a securitya stock in this case and relate it to the cash flows,the dividends.This is going to give us the discounted cash flow model.Our notation is going to be Pt for the expected stockprice at time t, this is the ex-dividend price,the price of the security immediatelyafter it pays off the dividend.Dt is the expected dividend at time t.And Rt is the expected stock return over period t.We start with an accounting identity,the definition of returns.1 plus the expected return is equal to the total cashflow at time 1, which is the dividendplus the price of the security, P1, dividedby the initial price, P0.This is the definition of expected return, R1.We can rewrite this formula to expressthe price of the security at time 0 in relationto the expected dividend a time 1,the expected price at time 1, and the expected return.The price at times 0 is equal to D1 plus P1, the expectedperiod for time 1 discounted at R1,the expected rate of return.The lesson here is that the pricecan be computed as expected cash flow discounted at the discountfactor, which is equal to the expectedreturn on the security.This relation is an accounting of mathematical identity.It doesn't rely on any economic assumptions.It is simply true because of how we define returnson securities.Now let's use our pricing formula and iterate forward.We are going to substitute out P1.We will replace it by the discounted value of D2 plus P2.What we obtain as a result is the relation within the priceat time 0 and the dividend at time 1, the dividend at time 2,and the price at time 2.Again, the price at time 0 is a discounted value of future cashflows at time 1 and 2.To simplify, let's assume that expected returnsduring every period are the same, they're equal to R.We can continue this process, continue moving forward,substituting out the price using our one period DCFformula to obtain the following equation, the price at time 0is equal to the sum of the expected dividendsduring future periods discounted at the rate of return Rplus the residual term, which is the price at time capitalT discounted at the rate of return, again,our expected return of the stock.The price of the stock is thereforeequal to the discounted value of future dividendsplus the discounted value of the terminal price, Pt.The discount factor equals the expected stock return.If we take this sum to a limit by letting capitalT go to infinity and make an additional assumptionthat the discounted value of the terminal price, p capital T,converges to 0, we obtain an infinite horizon discountedcash flow formula, which tells usthat the price of the stock at time 0is equal to the discounted value of future dividends from 1to infinity, where each expected future dividend is discountedat the expected rate of return on the stock.

PROFESSOR: We now apply our discounted cash flow formulato develop a canonical valuation model for stocks.This is the Gordon model.The Gordon model is also known as the constant growth model.And it's based under two key assumptions.First, we assume that the discount rate or the expectedreturn on the stock is constant across periods.Second, we assume that the growthrate of dividends in expectation is constant, as well.Dividends grow at the average rateequal to g, which is smaller than the discount rate, r.They grow at the same rate in perpetuity.With these two assumptions, we canderive the value of the firm at time zeroover the price of the stock in relationto the initial dividends.If we substitute into our discounted cash flowformula the relation between dividends across time, wherea dividend at time t plus 1 is expectedto be equal to the dividend at time t times 1plus the growth rate, we can see that we're dealingwith a growing perpetuity.And the value, the present value of this growing perpetuityis equal to the expected cash flow at time 1,D1, divided by r, the discount rate, minus g, the growth rate.This is the Gordon model.P0, the price of the stock, is equal to D1divided by r minus g.Let's look at an example.Suppose that the current dividend on the stock is 1.This is D0 equal to $1.We expect dividends to grow at a 6% rate per year forever,so g is equal to 6%.The expected return on the stock is 20%, so r is 0.2.In this case, the dividend at time 1, D1,is expected to be equal to 1 initial dividend times1 plus the growth rate.So that's $1.06.And the price of the stock is therefore$1.06 divided by the difference between the expected returnand the growth rate, which is 0.2 minus 0.06,which gives us $7.57.We can use this formula as the relation between pricesof securities, their expected dividends, expected returns,and growth rates of dividends.The Gordon model, the constant growth modelrelates the price dividend ratio to expected returns and growthrates.We can apply it in various ways.For example, we can look at market pricesand infer what the market expects future returns to beor what the projected growth rates for dividends are.As an example, let's consider a situationwhere we're using valuation ratios to forecast future stockreturns.Northern Company is a utility firm.Its dividends are going to grow in expectationat the constant rate forever.A utility firm, being a stable business,is a good candidate for applying this kind of constant growthmodel.The current dividend price ratio,which is also called dividend yield, D0 over P0,is equal to 4%.Analysts are forecasting the long-run growth of dividendsto be 5% per year.Based on the Gordon model, we can express the expected stockreturn in terms of the ratio of D1 to P0 and the growth rate.Specifically, expected stock returnis equal to D1 over P0 plus g, the growth rate of dividends.Because D1 is proportional to D0,we can replace D1 with D0 times 1 plus g, the growth rate.As a result, we can compute the expected return on the stock.It's equal to 1.05 times the dividend yieldof 4% plus the 5% growth rate.It's 9.2%.One thing to note is the relationbetween expected returns, dividend yield, and dividendgrowth.What we see is that the expected return on the stockis based on the growth rate of dividends and the dividendyield.In the second example, we are goingto forecast firm growth rate.The company here is Kendall Square Cuisine.It's a new health food franchise.For those of you who don't know, MITis located in Kendall Square.This company owns 10 restaurants as of now,and each of these restaurants is expected to generate 1 millionin profits every year forever, in perpetuity.This company, KSC, is expected to grow its marketshare over time by opening new restaurants.We're going to assume that it's goingto grow at a constant rate, which is not known.Each new restaurant is going to be justlike the old restaurants.They're going to generate $1 million in profits every yearforever.We're assuming that when the company opens a new restaurant,the cash flows start the following year.So if it were to open the restaurant this year,the first cash flow is going to arrive a year later.KSC is a publicly traded firm, and its current marketcapitalization is 200 million.We are assuming that the discountrate, the expected return on its stock is 10% per year,and that will remain constant forever.The question is, at what rate does the marketexpect KSC to grow, in terms of growing its numberof restaurants over time?For our company, this means that the growth rate, g,is equal to 0.1, which is the expected return,minus the total dividend next year, which is 10 million--remember that the company currently owns 10 restaurants,and each of them is going to generate 1 million next year--divided by the initial price, 200 million.The end result is that the expected growthrate, which is priced into the value of the firm, is 5%.In other words, based on the current valuationof this company, the market must be expecting the growthat the rate of 5%.So each year, the company is goingto increase its number of restaurants by 5%.

PROFESSOR: In this question, we willstart with the basics of the dividend discount model.Supposed that now is year zero.There is a firm called ABC and it is expected to pay $2.50dividend per share in next year or in Year 1.In the Year 2, you expect this dividend to remain at the samelevel or at $2.50.You also expect that ABC stock price will be $35 in Year 2.We will assume that the appropriate discountrate for the stock is 10%.The first question asks, what pricewould you be willing to pay for a share of ABC stocktoday if you planned to hold the stock for two years?Question b, suppose instead you planto hold the stock for one year.What price would you expect to beable to sell a share of ABC stock for in one year?And finally, question c, given the answer in part b,what price would you be willing to pay for a share of ABC stocktoday if you planned to hold the stock for one year?And then we will compare this answerto the one we've got in part a.So let's start with the first, with part a.It'd be useful to draw just a timeline for usto visualize what we'd get by buying this stock.So we're paying the current price or P0 right now.And then by holding the stock for two years,we get the following thing.So we get dividend, the first dividend at the end of Year 1.Again so here we're just assuming that the stockpays annual dividends.Then we also get dividend at the end of Year 2.And then we sell the stock at the price at the end of Year 2at P2.So therefore to find the current price of the stock P0,we just have to discount the two cash flows that weget in Year 1 and 2 to present.And so let us do that.So this is the equation.So P0 would equal to D1 divided by 1 plus r plus D2 plus P2divided by 1 plus r squared.We can put the numbers in.So we get $2.50 first dividend.We also get $2.50, the second dividend.And we expect that the price at the end of Year 2is going to be $35.We are given the discount rate, which is 10%.So all we have to do is to compute this value right now.So the current price will be $33.26.Now let's turn to part b, supposethat instead you plan to hold a stock only for one year.For how much you expect to be able to sell it in one year?So the question asks us what is our expectation, what wouldbe the stock price in Year 1.Well, we have a certain expectationfor the dividend in Year 2 and for the price in Year 2.So for us to estimate what would be the price in Year 1,we're taking the cash flows that weget from the stock in the Year 2 so this is the second dividendand the price in Year 2.And we would discount it to Year 1.So we're taking D2 plus P2 and dividing it by 1 plus 10%.If you put the numbers in, it tells usthat the stock price in the Year 1,or our expectation of how much we can sell, it,will be $34.09.Now finally, let's turn to part c of this question.So given our answer in part b right now,so given the price P1 that we just computed,what would be the price that you'rewilling to pay for a share of this stock today?If you again expect to be able to sell it in the Year 1 at P1?Well, then from this perspective,from this perspective of a one-year investor,the current price should be just the cash flowthat you get from the stock in Year 1.So it's your first dividend 2.50 plus P1.So this is for how much you're expectingto be able to sell this stock discounted to present.So D1 plus P1 divided by 1 plus r.Again, r here is 10% And so if we put the numbers in we get$2.50 plus $34.09.So this is the P1 that we computed in partb, divided by 1 plus 10%.And this gives us $33.26.So in fact, in part a of this question and in part c,we got exactly the same answer.So it's $33.26.We have demonstrated that the current priceP0, that the one-year investor and the two-year investorwilling to pay for this stock is the same.This is because the one-year investor alsocares about the dividend and price in Year 2.Because these determine the price at whichshe can sell the stock at the end of Year 1to an investor with similar beliefs.Now this last bit is very important.These two investors must have similar beliefs.If they don't, for example they differin their expectation what would bethe price of the stock in a Year 2,then of course they would disagreeabout the current stock price.Therefore, the very important lessonthat this question demonstrates is that disagreements in valueare due to difference in beliefs and notin the investment horizon.Because if these two investors have exactly the same beliefsabout the future dividends and the future prices of the stock,they will assign exactly the same value todayregardless of the investment horizon.

PROFESSOR: There is a company called Common App.It's a startup company that produces Common App.This company currently does not pay dividends.It's a startup company so it reinvests all of the earningsback into its operations.But it is expected that this company isgoing to start paying dividend in year fiveand the expectation is that the dividend in year fivewill be $1.After that it is expected that this dividend isgoing to grow at the expected rate of 3%,and this growth is going to continue into perpetuity,in other words forever.We will assume that the appropriate discountrate for the cash flows for the dividends from this stockis 12%.The question is, what is the current priceof a share of Common App?Let's use Gordon growth model to compute the price of the stock.First, I will put all the dividends on a timeline.So recall that in the first four yearsof the life of this company doesn't pay any dividendsbecause it's growing, it's reinvestingall of its earnings, and starting in year fiveit will start paying dividends.So the first dividend will be $1.From that point onwards the dividendis going to grow at 3% rate.So dividend in the year six for example,is just $1 multiplied by 1 plus 3%.I will do two steps in order to find the value of the stocktoday.First I will compute the value of all of these dividendsthat started in year five and continueto perpetuity as of year four.To do that I will simply use the growing perpetuity formula.So in this case, the price of the stock in year fouris going to be equal to the dividend in the year five,D5, divided by r minus g, g is the expected growthrate in dividends, r is the discount rate.So this is just a simple growing perpetuity.So D1 equals to $1 and we're dividing it by 12 minus 3%,this gives me $11.11.So this is the price of the stock in year four.Now to find the price of the stock right now,we need to take the P4 and discount it to present.So I'm simply taking P4 and I'm dividing itby 1 plus r raised to the power four,again, r is our discount rate, so 11.11,divided by 1 plus 12%, raise to the power four,this gives me the current price of $7.06.So the current price of this Common App stock is $7.06.

#### 415-1x_Rec 05_Q2, Part B-en

PROFESSOR: Now to practice, let me show you an alternative wayof solving this problem.Let me first start computing the shareprice as growing perpetuity, again, using Gordon growthdiscount model, but starting from dividends that weget from year six onwards.So what I will do is that I will findthe share price in year five as dividend 6 dividedby r minus g.So this is the value.This is the share price ex-dividendat point in time five that capturesthe value of all of the dividendsthat start in year six and continue forever.So recall that D6 is $1 multiplied by 1plus 3% percent.So it is dividing that by r minus g.So this gives me the share price of this stockin year five of $11.44.Now, to find the current price of the stock, what I will dois that I will take the share price in year five,plus I will add the dividend that we get in year five.Recall-- and this is important.Recall that share price in year five,the way we're computing it here, it'san ex-dividend share price.So it does not take into account the dividendit received in year five.So this value only counts dividendsstarting from year six onwards.So therefore, to compute the current share price,I'm taking the ex-dividend price in year five,I'm adding the dividend that I will receive in year five--this is $1--and I'm discounting all of this to present.So D5 plus P5 divided by 1 plus r, raised to the power of 5.So this gives me $1 plus $11.44--again, this is the share price in year five--divided by 1 plus 12%, raised the power of 5.And this gives me $7.06.So unsurprisingly, we've got exactly the same answeras we've gotten before.This is just to illustrate that as long as you're doing itconsistently, you can have, potentially,multiple ways of solving the same problem that gives youexactly the same answer.Again, the key is to make sure that you're countingall dividends properly.

PROFESSOR: iDoc is a health service company.It just paid dividends of $1.50.Over the next two years, iDoc is expectedto increase their dividends by 10% per year.After that, the expectation is that these dividendswill continue growing at 3% into perpetuity, so forever.We also know the appropriate discount rate for the dividendsof iDoc is 8%.The first question asks us to find the shareprice of iDoc right now.As the first step, let's put all of these dividendson the timeline.So the first dividends-- recall that iDoc just paid dividendof $1.50, which means that in year one,the dividend's going to be $1.50 times 1 plus 10%, right?So between year zero and year one, it's going to grow by 10%.Now, during the year two, it's going to grow by another 10%.So D2 is going to be equal to D1 multiplied by 1 plus 10%.Since after that point--so from year two until year three-- so this dividend,the growth rate is going to come down from 10% to 3%.So from this point, the dividend-- so dividend 3--is going to be equal to dividend 2,so D2 multiplied by 1 plus 3%.And now, from year three onwards,this growth's going to continue at 3%.So sometimes, this is referred to as a two-stage Gordon GrowthModel.So we have the first growth stage,where the dividends grow at 10%.And then, we'll have the second stage where dividendsgrow at a lower rate of 3%.This represents reality often quite wellbecause a lot of companies start at the high growth stagewhen they're younger.So in this case, this company grows at 10%.And then, this growth slows down and becomes perpetual growthrate.So in this case, it is 3%.When we deal with a multistage Gordon Growth Model,the recipe to solve this question is as follows.First, we will start at the terminal growth stage--so in this case, the growth stage two.What we'll do is that we'll find the share price at the startof that terminal growth stage.So we'll compute P2.So P2 would equal to dividend that we'd get in year 3, so D3.So again, this would be a next dividend shareprice in the year 2.So P2 is going to equal to D3 dividedby r minus this terminal growth rate, which is--I'll denote here as g2.So this is my 3%.This is to differentiate this from the initial growthrate of 10%.And now, I can compute D3 and I can compute P2.So D3 is going to be equal to--recall that this is D2 multiplied by 1 plus 3%.And we know that D2 is D1 multiplied by 1 plus 10%,and D1 is initial $1.50 multiplied by 1 plus 10%.So if we collect this altogether, so D3would equal to initial 1.5 multipliedby 1.1 multiplied by 1.1 one moretime and multiplied by 1.03.So this will give me dividend in the year 3.And so I'm dividing it by 8%, which is my discountrate, minus this 3%.This is the second growth stage growth rate.So this gives me $37.39.The final step in finding the current share pricein a two-stage growth model is to take the share priceat the start of the second and terminal growth stage, P2,discounted to present, and take all of the dividends thataccrued to shareholders during the first growth stageand discount them to present as well.This together would give us the current share price.In our case, this is the D1 discountedto present plus D2 discounted to present plus P2, whichis the share price at the start of the second growth stage,and discounted to present as well.We know that D1 is the current dividends, $1.50,multiplied by 1 plus 10%.10% is our growth rate during the first stage.D2 is the current dividend multipliedby 1 plus 10% squared.P2-- that we just computed as $37.39,and we're discounting all of these cashflows to present at the current discount rate of 8%.This gives us the current share price of $35.14.And this is how you find the current share pricein a two-stage growth model.

#### 415-1x_Rec 05_Q3, Part B-en

PROFESSOR: The second part of the questionasks us to find share price of iDoc in the Year 1.To help us solve this problem, I will put everythingon the timeline again.So dividend 2 is going to be equalto a 1.5 times 1.1 squared.And we already computed the share price in Year 2.So the share price in Year 2 is 37.39.So to find the share price in Year 1, all we need to dois that we need to take this payments in Year 2that would get as stockholders and to discount them to Year 1.So we're taking D2 plus P2 and we're dividing it by 1 plus r.And this would give us P1.So putting this all together, we get 1.5 times 1.1 squared.So this is D2 plus 37.39 this is the share price in Year 2,and we're dividing it by 1 plus 8%.This gives us $36.30.So the share price in the year one would be $36.30.Now again, let me re-emphasize that this is ex-dividendshare price.So it does not take into account the dividendthat this company iDoc is expected to pay in the Year 1.So this is ex-dividend price in the Year 1.And you can see that we are only counting Dividend 2and the share price in Year 2.So P1 equals to 36.30.Let me show an alternative way of solving this question.Let's start with the fundamental equationthat ties the share price today with the share price in Year 1.So the share price today must equal to the dividendthat we get in the Year 1 plus the share price in Year 1discounted to present, so divided by 1 plus r.If we rearrange this equation for P1,so P1 is going to equal to P0 multipliedby 1 plus r minus Dividend 1.So we can use this equation because we alreadyfound the current share price of P0in the first part of this question.So I will take this P0 that we before,so 35.14, multiplied by 1 plus r.So recall again that r is 8%.And minus the Dividend 1 that we expect to receive in Year 1.So this is 1.5 multiplied by 1.1.So computing this value gives us $36.30.And so this is exactly the same valueas we've got in here by just computing the share price as--share price in Year 1 as discountedsome of the dividend in Year 2 plus the share priceand Dividend 2 discounted to Year 1.So either this way or this way, we've got exactly the sameshare price of 36.30.

#### 415-1x_Rec 05_Q4, Part A-en

PROFESSOR: In this question, we will consider a simple modelof investment and growth.Let me start by laying out main assumptions.First, assets don't depreciate.This means that, even without new investmentthe current earnings, or more specifically earnings per shareis going to stay constant at the current level.Investment at time t starts generating earningsin year t plus 1.Investments generate perpetual earnings stream.And finally, investment opportunitiesare characterized by ROI, which is the Return On Investment.Let me give you a very specific example of an investmentopportunity.Suppose a firm invests $100 millioninto a factory today in Year 0.Let's say that the return on investments or ROI is 15%.Then in the case of this firm, this investmentwill start producing earnings in Year 1and these earnings will continue forever.And these earnings will be $15 millionwhich you compute as the investment $100 millionmultiplied by ROI, which is our return on investment.So 100 multiply by 15%, this gives us $15 million.And this is annual perpetual earningsthat this investment generates.Now let's work with the specific example.We will consider a firm, let's call it ABC.The profitability of ABC and its investment policyare summarized in this table below.The company is going to have, today, the book valueper share of $100.Next year, it is expected to generateearnings per share of $20.And then the plow-back ratio, whichmeans the percentage of earnings per sharethat the company retains and reinvests,are given as follows.So in Year 1, the company plans to retain 80% of earningsand reinvest.So that's our plow-back ratio.In year 2 and 3, 50%.And then they don't plan to retain any of the earnings.They plan to pay them all out in the form of dividend.And finally the last row indicates the returnon investments this company will generate on these new earnings.So in Year 1, it's 20%, then 15%, then 10%.And then it is going to continue at 10% forever.We will assume that the appropriate discountrate in this question is 12%.Let's look at the relationship between the key variables.I will denote by B sub t, the plow-back ratioof the company in the year t.Investment, as I denote here by I in the year twould be the fraction of earnings per sharethat we retain.So this will be also investment per share.So earnings per share multiplied by the plow-back ratio,this will be our investments in the year t.The next year's earnings per share, EPS and t plus 1,would be this year's Earnings Per Share, EPSin year t plus ROI, this is the profitabilityof our investments multiplied by the amount that we reinvested,I.The book value per share will be the prior year's bookvalue per share plus this new investmentsthat we made this year.And finally, dividends would be the part of EPSthat would be in retained so we pay it out to shareholdersin the form of dividend.So more specifically it is EPS in year t multipliedby 1 minus plow-back ratio b.Recall that 1 minus b is the payout ratio that we sometimesdenote as small p.This is the fraction of the EPS that we pay outin the form of dividend.Hence the name, the payout ratio.

#### 415-1x_Rec 05_Q4, Part B-en

PROFESSOR: Let's solve this question.And by solving this question, I mean finding the current shareprice and understanding the dynamics of the key variableshere.So in this spreadsheet I put the informationthat we're given in the question.And I would like to start computing and fillingin the blanks for all of the key variables that we have here.Down at the bottom here, I've written the key equations.So let's start with investment.So by definition, investment in Year 1would be the EPS multiplied by the plow-back ratio.So that's going to be $16.It does make sense because our EPS is 20.We're retaining 80% of that.So that's $16.So our investments in Year 1 is $16.Now we can compute EPS in Year 2 which would be EPS in Year 1plus ROI in Year 1 which is 20%, multipliedby the investment which is $16.And so the earnings per share in Year 2 is going to be $23.20.Now we can also compute the book value per sharein year one, which would be the prior book value per shareplus the investments that we made in Year 1.And let's also compute the dividend, whichwould be the earnings per share multipliedby 1 minus the plow-back ratio.So dividend in Year 1 is $4.And now we can compute the same calculation.So again investments in Year 2 willbe our new earnings per share multipliedby the plow-back ratio.So it's going to be $11.60.Earnings per share is going to be $24.94, again computedas the prior year's earnings per shareplus ROI multiplied by the investment.Book value per share, again, is justprior year's book value per share plus the new investment.And the dividends, again, this is justEPS multiplied by 1 minus plow-back ratio.You can see that because in the Year 2we are retaining half of the EPS.And half of it we are paying out as dividends.So of course, investment and dividendsare the same in in the Year 2.And now all I can do is that I can just simply do this,stretch all these arrays down.And because we have these equations,we will be able to compute the key variables going forward.Now we could see that again.So in Year 3 for example, where we retain halfand we pay out half of our EPS, so investment and dividendis the same.Then of course starting in Year 4,because we don't retain any of the earnings,the investment is 0.And therefore, earnings per sharestays constant starting from Year 4 onwards.And in fact, dividends equal earnings per sharestarting from Year 4.And it does make sense because wedon't retain any earnings we pay them all out in dividends.And you could also see that because investment is 0so our book value per share staysconstant forever after Year 3.Now let's look at the relationship between the EPSand ERT plus 1, and EPS and ERT, and understandwhere this equation comes from.So what I will do here right now is that I will actuallywrite down year by year earnings per share thatcomes from the existing assets and from these new investmentsthat we're making.So what I mean is that in Year 1, so there is Year 1 EPS.So for example, if we have not invested anything at all,our EPS would have stayed at $20 forever.Because this is what was given to us.And so this $20 is something thatis generated by the existing assets,by the book value per share that wehad prior to making these new investments.Now the remaining EPS comes from, again,these new investments.So in Year 2, we're getting additional earningsper share from the $16 investmentsthat we made in Year 1.So here I will denote what this is.And so this is just 20% multiplied by $16 investment.And so, because we said that these investments are such thatthey produce earnings per share in perpetuity.So this $16 and 20% ROI on this investment produces $3.20.And these earnings will continue in perpetuity.So here I'm doing just 10 years, but theywill continue into perpetuity.So similarly, in the Year 2, we invest $11.60 and our ROI is15.So starting from Year 2, the new additional EPSthat we get from that investment is just, again,this ROI multiplied by the investment.And again, by the same logic, this EPS will continue forever.And the final investments here we're making in the Year 3where we're investing $12.47.And our ROI at that point is 10%.So we're generating, we're starting generatingthis new EPS in Year 4.And this equals to the investment times ROI.And again, this continues forever.So what I've done in this last columnis that so here I'm going to add up all of these EPS.So in the Year 1, or I'll just sum them all up,and of course in Year 1 we just have the initial $20.And then we're adding up all of the investments that our--all of the earnings per share that our new investmentsgenerate.And we could, of course, see that the column that I justcomputed here, and let me color it in red,it's the same exact as the EPS that we've computed hereby using this expression.You can see that this is just mechanically happensbecause we're just--once this investment generates the EPS of 3.20 in the firstyear, in Year 2, we're continuing adding it upbecause we are writing down those recursive relationship.And so therefore this equation does make sense.But this was just to illustrate that these new investments,indeed, generate perpetual earnings.And this is how we are computing the EPS in year t plus 1and relating it to EPS in the year t.And this equation is indeed giving usthe correct earnings per share given the assumptionsthat we made in this model.Finally, let us compute the share price.We could see that starting from Year 4,the dividends are constant.And therefore from Year 4 onwards,this is just a simple perpetuity.So for example, we can start by finding the shareprice in Year 9.So I will take the dividends in Year 10and I'll just divide it by r.This is our discount rate.Again, this is just because this isa perpetuity and the current share price or shareprice in the Year 9 is the present valueof all of the dividends the start from Year 10.And because this is a perpetuity,this is the value of share in the Year 9.And then we can just backfill that all the way to Year 0by doing this.So for example, in Year 8, what would be the share price?Well, the share price would be the dividendsthat we get in Year 9 plus the share priceit will be in Year 9 discounted by one year to Year 8.So I can just write down this fundamental relationshipbetween the price of one share in Year 8 and Year 9.So of course, not surprisingly, ithas to be the same, because there was an alternative way,we could have just written down the same perpetuity presentvalue formula and it will have given us the same answer.So that all makes sense.But what this allows me to do is that this justallows me to stretch this array all the way to 0.And this will automatically compute the share price for me.Because again, what I'm doing is that in every year,for example, in the Year 1, the way I'm comparing the shareprice, I'm taking the dividend theywill get in Year 2 and the share price that will be in Year 2and then I'm just discounting it to Year 1.So because this is, again, fundamental relationshipthat ties the price right now with the dividend and the pricenext period discounted to the periodbefore, this has to be correct.And so therefore the current share price of the stockis $177.02.

PROFESSOR: As an investor in the stock ABC,what is the expected return that you willget from holding this stock?Let's compute it using the dividend stream and the prices,the expected the prices per share,that we computed in this question.So let's start with this fundamental relationshipbetween the price today and the pricetomorrow plus the dividends that we get from holdingthe stock discounted to today.So what I will do right now is that I willrearrange this equation for r.This is our expected return.So this is the first step, and this is the second step.So the expected return equals to the dividendthat we expect to receive from the share tomorrow dividedby the price today plus price tomorrow minus pricetoday divided by price today.So recall that this first part, D over p,we referred to as dividend yield.And the second part, price tomorrow minus price todaydivided by price today, this is whatwe refer to as capital gains.And I will use this relationship to compute the expected returnon the stock of ABC.Let's start by computing expected returnthat we will get between year zero and year onefrom holding this stock.So it's next year's dividends divided by today's shareprice-- so this is the dividend yield--plus capital gain.So this is the share price in the yearone minus the current share price dividedby the current share price, and this gives me 12%.And I could just extend this arrayand continue this calculation all the way to later years.And we'll see that in every year,it's just going to be 12%.For example, in all of the subsequent years,because the share price stays the same,we only get dividends.And the dividend yield in all of the subsequent yearsis exactly 12%.Now this, of course, should not surprise usbecause the expected return is constant.And it's 12%, and it actually equals the discount ratethat we used, which is the expected return on this stock.So what we've done right now is that we are actuallydoing this calculation backwards because we could've justanswered this question by saying,well, we already know what is expected returnbecause we were discounting these cashflows at the 12% rate.So the expected return has to be 12%.But right now, we just computed thisby using the dividend yield and the capital gainsfrom the dividends and share pricesthat we computed in this question.

PROFESSOR: Let's compute the present valueof growth opportunities of this firm ABC.Recall that we define the present valueof growth opportunities as the current price.So this is the price that we justcomputed in this question given our investment opportunitiesand our investment policy minus what would have happenedif we didn't invest and we just continued status quofrom year 1 onwards.So if we haven't invested anythingand we paid out all of our earningsstarting from Year 1 as dividends,our earnings per share would have stayedconstant at $20 level forever.And this would have been our dividends.So our dividends per share would havebeen $20 starting from Year 1 and continuing onwards.So therefore, the present value without growthor without us investing in these new opportunitieswould have been just EPS in Year 1 divided by r.So that's the present value of this perpetuity.So in our case, this is $117.02.So this is the price with our current investmentpolicy minus 20 divided by 12% and this gives us $10.36.So the current value of ABC's growth opportunities,of course on a per share basis because this whole calculationon a per share basis, is $10.36.In other words, each shareholder herebenefits by increasing his or her share price by $10.36from this investment policy that this firm undertakes.Now let us do a very interesting counterfactual analysis here.What happens if we did not retain any earnings in Year 3and we would have paid out the entire EPS in Year 3as dividends?In other words, what if this number that Icolored in green right now, instead of being 50%would have been 0%?What would have happened to our share price?Would it increase?Would it stay the same?Or would it decrease?The answer depends on, of course,what is the return on investment that our new investmentsgenerate in this particular year.And in this case, this is 10%.Remember that we're discounting our cash flows at 12%and this is the expected return, this is the riskthat our investors associate with the cashflows that this company generates.So therefore, if we are only earning 10% on our investments,this is below the level of risk thatis assessed by our investors.So it stands to reason that we are losing valueby investing in projects that generatethe return on investment that is below the expectedreturn on this stock.And so in fact if I put 0 here again.So this would just indicate that instead of reinvestingwe're just paying everything out to shareholders,we could see that our share price actual increases.If I put 0 here instead of 177.02,our current share price would be 178.50.And then, of course, if we do the same the year before.So we've reinvested 50% in Year 2But are ROI is actually very good.It's 15% relative to the expected return of 12%.So if I put 0 here, now of course the share pricehas to drop because we're not investing in very attractiveinvestment opportunities.So let's see what happens if it put 0% here, the share pricedrops to $176.19.To summarize, the optimal investment policyis to invest in investment opportunities thathave a return on investment or ROIthat is above the expected return of the discount ratethat we're using to discount dividends from this stock.

#### 415-1x_Rec 05_Q5, Part A-en

PROFESSOR: In this question, we will consider a constant growthmodel.Let's take a firm, ABC.This firm is expected to produce earnings per sharein Year 1 that equals to $20.ABC's return on investment or ROI is 20%.And this ROI is expected to remain constant at this levelforever.Notice the difference between this questionand question 4 where ROI was not constant.So for this particular firm ROI is currently 20%and it is expected to be constant.ABC's current payout ratio is 55%and it is also expected to remain at that level forever.The appropriate discount rate is 12%.We will answer two questions.First, we will derive the share price of the stockand then we will derive its present valueof growth opportunities.Let's follow the approach we have established in Question 4.I have put EPS that we expect to get from this firm in Year1, $20 earnings per share.Now I will put plowback ratio.Recorded plowback ratio is 1 minus the payout ratio.So that means that we are plowing back 45% of EPSin the Year 1.And this plowback ratio remains constant forever.ROI equals to 20%.And again, this rate will remain constant forever.Now let's compute the investment as EPS times the plowbackratio.The dividends is simply the EPS multipliedby 1 minus the plowback rate or the payout rate.And then EPS in the Year 2 will bethe prior year's EPS plus ROI multiplied by the investment.And so we can just trace these arrays all the way forwardand get these numbers.So we'll get investments and we'll get dividends.Now let's look at the dividend stream.Unlike the previous question, Question 4,where we've stopped plowing back and we'vestarted paying out all earnings per shareas dividends at some point, So here wecontinue plowing back at a constant rate.So in this case, dividends always seem to grow.And they don't stop.So this is the difference between this questionand the question that we had before.Now let's compute dividend growth rateand see at what rate dividends grow in this model.So I'll compute the growth rate between the year 2 and 1.So I'll take dividend in Year 2 minus the dividend in the Year1.And I'll divide it by the dividend in the Year 1.And so this seems to be 9%.And I can just extend this array to seewhat is the dividend growth rate for the subsequent years.And what we see here, very interestingly,that the dividend growth rate seems to be constant and beat the rate of 9%.And I'm doing it only for the first 10 years.But if we were to extend this all the way to Year 100,we will actually find out that the dividend growthrate remains at 9%.And so this is a very interesting fact of this modelthat constant-- there is constant growthrate in dividends here.Now let's see if we can analyticallyderive the dividend growth rate in this model.Let b be the plowback ratio.And so then the dividends in year tis 1 minus the plowback ratio, again the payout ratio,at times earnings per share in that year t.Similarly, next period's dividend is this.So I colored b here in color red justto denote that this b, the plowback ratio,is not going to change.It's going to be constant.So this b here is the same in period t plus 1and in period t.Now recall that earnings per share in year t plus 1equals to the prior period's earnings per share plus ROItimes investment.So again, here ROI is constant.So I deleted the subscript t from ROI.And then investment, of course, is justEPS times the plowback ratio.And again, this plowback ratio is constant.Then we can write down the EPS in the yeart plus 1 as EPS in year t multiplied by1 plus ROI times b.And now we can plug this in to our dividend equationfor year t plus 1 which would be 1 minus the plowbackratio times EPS in year t multiplied by 1 plus ROI timesb.And now we can actually compute the dividend growthrate, which is dt plus 1 minus dt divided by dt.And I will express that as Dt plus 1 divided by dt minus 1.And now into this equation, I will plug in our expressionsfor dt plus 1 and dt.So we just derived what was the Dt plus 1.So it's 1 minus b multiplied by EPS in year t multipliedby 1 plus ROI times b.And dt is just 1 minus b times EPS in year t.So you could see that 1 minus b and EPS cancels out.Then what we have is just 1 plus ROI times b minus 1,which is just ROI times b.So in this model as long as the firmmaintains constant plowback ratio and has constant ROI,the dividend growth rate will be time independent.So it will be constant.And it will be the product of the returnon investment this firm has and the plowback ratio.And that's a very important equation that we just derived.Now going back to our spreadsheet,it should not surprise us right nowthat the dividend growth rate here is 9% and it is constant.Indeed, if I were to compute it just giventhe payout ratio and ROI is just simplythe plowback ratio which is 1 minus the payoutratio multiplied by ROI.And so indeed is just 9%.And this growth rate will remain constant,as we just analytically showed.And so then just to find the current share price,realizing the dividends here grow at a constant rate, 9%,and this will be a perpetual constant growth rate as longas, again, the plowback ratio and ROI stay constant,so all we need to do to find the current shareprice because it's the growing perpetuity so we're takingthe dividend that we get in year oneand we're dividing it by r which is our discount rate 12 percentminus the dividend growth rate of 9%.And so the current share price of the stock is $366.67.

#### 415-1x_Rec 05_Q5, Part B-en

PROFESSOR: Let's compute the present valueof growth opportunities of this company ABC.Let's first develop intuition.Recall that our ROI is 20%, so all our investmentsgenerate perpetual return of 20%.And the discount rate for the dividends of the stockis 12%, which means the expected return is12% is lower than the return on investmentthat this firm generates.So therefore, we should be expectingthat this company has positive present value of growthoptions.And so let's compute it.We will do exactly the same calculationas we've done in the previous question.So I will take first and compute the no growth share price.So if this firm would not blow back any of the earnings,starting in year one and starting paying them outas dividends in year one.In this case, the dividend level and EPSwould continue staying at 20% per share.And therefore, the no growth share priceis going to be just simply 20 divided by 12%.Because it's just going to be a regular perpetuityof 20% of $20 forever.And so this is no growth share price.And so the present value of growth options by definitionis the current share price minus no growth share price.And so in this case it's going to be $200.You could see that this is the company thatderives a lot of its current shareprice, a lot of its current market valuefrom these growth opportunities.And indeed it should again make sensebecause their return investment is very high, it's 20%.So in fact we can compute what fraction of the current shareprice comes from these growth opportunities, whichis then doing this calculation.So taking the present value growth optionsand dividing it by the share price.And we can say that almost 55% of this stock priceis derived from the future growth opportunities.And the remaining 45% come from the existing assets.We can also check to see what happens if ROI wouldhave been lower and not 20%.For example, if ROI instead would had been 15%,we would intuitively expect that the present valueof growth options of this company would have been lower.And therefore, the fraction of share pricethat is attributable to growth optionswould have been lower as well.So let's try doing that.To put 15% here, we see that the presence of our growth optionsand the fraction of those growth options in the share pricedrops to 20%.And of course, if ROI would be 12%, whichwould have been the same as the cost of capitalfor this company, the discount rate that we're using, 12%.In this case, intuitively, the presence of our growth optionsshould have been 0.And so if I hit Enter, it indeed shows me that PVGO is 0and the share price is the same as itwould have been if this company did notlog back any of its earnings.

PROFESSOR: In this question, we'llconsider a firm that has multiple divisionsand we will see how investments affectthe market value of the firm.Consider Firm XYZ that has two lines of business,organized as divisions A and B. Both of these divisionsare risky and generate risky cash flows.Division A expects to generate a cash flow of $2 millionnext year, and this cash flow willgrow at a rate of 3% each year forever.Division B expects to generate a cash flow of $2 millionnext year as well, but the cash flow from this divisionwill grow at 5% forever.So division B has a higher growth rate comparedto division A. Currently, the total market value of XYZis $87 million.The cost of capital for the first line of business is 10%.The first question asks, what is the costof capital for the second line of business?This by itself is a very interesting questionbecause it makes us realize that divisions in a firmcan be different and they may have different business risk,as we discussed early in the class.And so therefore, for this particular firm,division A has a level of risk that correspondsto the 10% cost of capital.But division B may have a different costof capital, which this question asks us to compute.So let's compute it.Let's first start with this equationthat tells us that the value of the firmhas to be equal to the sum of the value of the two divisions.So these are market values.Now, each division produces a perpetual cash flow thathas a constant growth rate.So it can compute the value of each divisionas just simply the present value of growing perpetuity.So both of these divisions next yearwill produce a cash flow of $2 million.And we know the discount rate for the first division, 10%,minus the growth rate of 3%.This would be the present value of the cash flowthat is generated by the first division.We have the similar equation for the second division,$2 divided by rb minus 5.So 5 is the growth rate for the second division.And rb is the discount rate, which we actually don't know.But we know that the market value of this firm rightnow is $87 million.So therefore, we have this equation.And it looks like there is only one unknown in this equation,so we can solve it for rb, which is, again, the discountrate for division B.Solving this equation gives us rb of 8.42%.So this means that the second division isless risky than the first one.And therefore, its cost of capitalis lower than the cost of capital of division A, whichwas, again, 10%.

#### 415-1x_Rec 05_Q6, Part B-en

PROFESSOR: Assume that the firm is planningon making an investment which will improve profitabilityof both divisions A and B. This project requiresan initial investment of $7 million right nowand will increase cash flow for both divisions by $0.5 millionstarting in the year 3.This additional cash flow will growat the same rate as other cash flowsin each division, which means it willgrow at the rate of 3% in division Aand it will grow at 5% in division B.Assume that the cost of capital for both divisionsis not affected by this project.If management decides to invest in this new technology,by how much will the current market value of XYZ increase?Well, let's compute the NPV of this project.The NPV of this project equals to the initial investmentthat we have to make right now of $7 millionplus the new cash flow that this project will generate.The first part of this equation is the present valueof the increase in the cash flowsthat accrues to division A.In squared parentheses, we have $0.5 million.This is the cash flow that will start in year 3.And we're discounting it to presentby dividing it by 10% minus 3% because it'sa growing perpetuity.This cash flow is going to grow at 3%,and the discount rate here is 10%because this is the risk of division A.And since this cash flow starts in year 3,by applying the growing perpetuity formula,this gives us value in the year two.So to find the present value, we'rediscounting or dividing it by 1 plus 10% raisedto the power of 2.I highlighted power of 2 here in different colorsso that we understand that the growing perpetuity formulagives us the value in year two.Similarly, for division B, the present valueof this additional cash flow is, again,$0.5 million that accrues to division B.And we're discounting it here at the cost of capital of divisionB. And again, we're realizing that this cash flow of $0.5million will grow in this division at 5% rate,similarly to the growth rate in all of the other cash flowas well.So therefore, we have the growing perpetuity formulain the squared parentheses.And then, we're dividing it and we'rebringing it to present by, again,using the appropriate cost of capital for division B.Computing this net present value, we get $11.33 million.So therefore, the new market value of firm XYZis $87 million--what it was before--plus the present value or the netpresent value of this new investment project,which is $11.33 million.So this brings up the market value of XYZ to $98.33 million.This is an increase of $11.33 divided by $87 million.So this is an increase of 13.02%.So by engaging in this investment project,the management of the company increases its value by 13.02%.

PROFESSOR: We will now introduce our main result, portfoliodiversification.First, let's look at an example before we take a deeper diveinto the analytics.Consider a portfolio of two securities.This time we are going to look at two individual stocks, IBMand Intel.These are both large technology stocks.We form a portfolio with equal investmentsin these two securities.When we compare the volatilities of individual investmentson IBM and Intel to that of the portfolio,we see that the volatility of portfolio returnsis lower than either of the two volatilities.By combining these two securitiesinto a single portfolio, we are able to reduce risk.It is now lower than it would havebeen for any one of these two as individual investments.This is an example of all one canachieve by diversifying risk.It is intuitive why the risk of the portfoliomay be relatively low.These two stocks, IBM and Intel, are different companieswith their own firm-specific risks.They have a lot in common.They are both technology stocks.They're both exposed to macroeconomic news.But they also have individual components.By combining them into the portfolio,we are able to reduce the impact of individual firm-specificrisk.When one of these stocks is up for idiosyncratic reasons,the other one may be down.This kind of consolidation is whatenables us to reduce the portfolio risk.More formally, we will see that a reduction in portfolio riskis based on the covariance of returns between the two assets.The following graph illustrates the concept of diversification.We start with two securities with identical volatilities,35% in this case.We make several alternative assumptionsabout the degree of correlation between the two assets.One extreme case will be when the correlationis perfect, equal to 1.Most of the time correlation is imperfect,so we look at a few alternative values, 0.5, 0,and even a negative number, minus 0.5.What we see is that as the correlation between the twosecurities declines, the volatility of the portfoliogets progressively lower.This illustrates the power of diversification.The case of the negative correlation of 0.5leads to the largest reduction in riskthrough diversification.Now, let's step back and think a bitabout the limits of diversification as a tool.What can we hope to achieve?Some of the risks are truly security specific.And by combining assets into a portfolio,we can hope to reduce the impact of these risks significantly.There are certain kinds of risks that are broad,that affect multiple assets or perhaps the entire market.These types of risks cannot be eliminated throughdiversification.As a result, there are two types of risks that we candistinguish, diversifiable--these are the types of shocks thatcan be eliminated or significantly reducedthrough diversification by forming portfolios--and non-diversifiable-- these types of riskssurvive portfolio formation.They are present even in well diversified portfolioswith many assets.There are several intuitive examplesof important non-diversifiable risks,for example, business cycle shocks.They affect multiple businesses in the same direction.As a result, forming a portfolio of stocksdoes not help eliminate exposuresto business cycle shocks.Inflation shocks are another example.They affect multiple assets in the same direction.A spike in inflation is going to affect a portfolioin the same way it affects individual assets.Shocks to market liquidity have a similar effect.Many securities decline in value whenmarket liquidity deteriorates.Not all of them do.As we will see in other classes, thereare exceptions to this rule.And securities like US Treasuriestend to move in the opposite direction.What this tells us is that exposure to the common shockslargely affects financial assets in the same way.But not all of them have identical exposures.It's a relatively nuanced picture.Nonetheless, it is clear that shockslike liquidity shocks, inflation shocks, and business cycleshocks are different in nature from firm-specific risks, whichcan be eliminated or reduced by diversification.Let's take a closer look at the mechanics of diversification.How does it work?And what are the limits to what we couldachieve through this process?Consider an equally-weighted portfolio of n securities.The covariance matrix of returns has diagonal elementsdenoted by sigma ii--these are the individual variances of asset returns--and off-diagonal elements, sigma ij,which give us covariances of returns,asset i versus asset j.To compute the variance of the portfolio return,we need to sum over all of the elementsin the covariance matrix multipliedby the product of portfolio weights.In our special case of the equally-weighted portfolio,all portfolio weights are the same.They're equal to 1 over n.What we see as a result is that the varianceof portfolio returns is a sum of the diagonal terms.Each of them is equal to 1 over nsquared times the variance of asset i's returnand the sum of the off-diagonal elements, whichis the sum of 1 over n squared times sigma ij over all valuesof i and j that are not equal to each other.The key observation here is that in a large matrix,in a portfolio with many assets, thereare a lot more off-diagonal elements than thereare the diagonal elements.In fact, in case of n assets in the portfolio,there are n squared minus n off-diagonal elements.To put it into perspective, in a portfolio of 100 assets,there are only 100 diagonal elements.And there are almost 10,000 off-diagonal elements--9,900 to be precise.When we put together all of the termsin the expression for the portfolio variance,we can see that the expression separates into two terms.The first is 1 over n times the average varianceof individual returns.The second term is very close to the average pair-wisecovariance of returns.As the number of assets in the portfolio increases,the first term converges towards 0.The second term does not disappear.In fact, it converges to the average covariance of returns.What this result tells us is that in a well-diversifiedportfolio with many assets, variance of portfolio returnsis determined by the average covarianceof individual returns rather thanby their own risk or their own variance.This tells us where the limit of the diversification is.By forming a large portfolio with many assetsand diversifying risk, we will beable to eliminate firm-specific risk, asset-specific risk.And we will be left with the average covariance, whichcaptures the contribution of systematic risks, those thatare common to multiple assets.To gain further intuition, let's plugin some numbers that are typical for empirical distributionsof asset returns.On average, a standard deviation of a stock in the US stockmarket is close to 10% per month.A typical number for pair-wise correlations is 40%.Using our previous expression, wecan then compute the average covarianceof returns in the portfolio.The covariance is a product of the correlation coefficientand individual return volatilities.In our case, this product is equal to 0.004.That is the average covariance of returns in the portfolio.As we have shown, the variance of a well-diversified portfoliois equal to this number, the average covariance of returns,which tells us that portfolio volatility is close to 6%.We can see that by starting with individual assetswith 10% return volatility and diversifying,we are able to eliminate some of the risk.We reduce portfolio risk to close to 6%.We're not able to reduce it to 0, because some of the riskis common to multiple assets.But we are able to eliminate a significant fraction of riskfrom the portfolio.What if correlation was different?What if it was equal to 1 or 0?In this case, you would find different limitsto diversification.As you can see from the graph, in the caseof perfect correlation, or equal to 1,diversification does not reduce portfolio risk.This is very intuitive.Correlation equal to 1 means that all assets move togetherin unison.There is no benefit in combining them into a portfolio.We cannot reduce the risk.Correlation equal to 0 gives us more room to diversify.0 correlation means that the covariance of returnson any pair of assets is 0.And that tells us that in a limit, whenthe number of assets goes to infinity,the variance of portfolio returns will converge to 0.In this case, we can eliminate all of the risk in the limitas the portfolio grows in the number of assets.The curve in the middle is the case that we just explored,average correlation equal to 0.4.You can see that in this case, some of the portfolio riskcan be eliminated through diversification.And some of it is left.Whatever is left is what we call systematic non-diversifiablerisk.Another lesson from this graph isthat it doesn't take many assets to reduce risk of the portfoliosignificantly.Starting from a single investmentand moving to 4 or 10 or 20 assets in the portfolio,we can realize most of the benefits of diversification.Going past 50 or 100 assets has little additional benefit.

PROFESSOR: In this class, we're goingto talk about fundamental concepts, risk and return.These are at the core of financial modelsand decision-making.Managing and measuring risk is the kind of problemthat shows up in many contexts.For example, think about an investor saving for retirement.One can adopt a safer strategy providinga higher likelihood of reaching a target, but a lower upside.Or an investor can pursue a riskier strategy--invest more in equities, for example--providing higher likelihood of an upsidebut also a higher chance of falling short.A hedge fund needs to decide how to allocate capitalacross multiple investment strategies.This depends on the risk of individual strategies, whichhas to be measured and managed, as well asthe joint distribution of returns on multiple strategies.An insurance company which sells multiple types of products--life insurance, casualty insurance--has to decide how to model the joint distribution of risk.How do you quantify the risk at the firm level?Is it the case that individual insurance contractsare roughly independent and the risk can be diversified?Or is there a common component whichis going to translate into firm-level risk?A sovereign wealth fund, when formulating an investmentstrategy, needs to be aware of how financial risks arerelated to the underlying risks of the country's economy.All of these problems are examples of risk measurementand risk management.In order to make decisions under uncertainty,we need an analytical, mathematical framework.In this class, we're going to introduce the Expected UtilityTheory.This theory quantifies decision-making and the riskand can be used as a basis of portfolio choice in particular.We are going to develop analytical toolsfor quantifying risk, for measuring it,and apply them to investment decisions.This all comes under the broader umbrellaof portfolio analytics.We will also introduce the concept of diversification.Diversification is a process of eliminating risksby pooling investments into a portfolio.Many call diversification the only remaining free lunchin financial markets.

#### 415-1x_Lec_6-2_05-en

PROFESSOR: In this segment, we'lltalk about the expected utility theory.So let's start with a basic decision problemunder uncertainty.Suppose you're choosing between two gambles, gamblex, gamble y.Gamble x allows you to win $1,000or to get nothing with 50/50 odds.Gamble y gives you a 70% chance of winning $600 or 30%chance of winning $200.Which of these choices is preferred?Now, a naive approach would be to compute expected payoffsand then choose the higher one.But what about randomness?What about risk?We know that a 50/50 gamble of winning $1,000or getting nothing is not the same as getting $500 for sure.Most people are averse to this kind of risk.How should we quantify the trade offbetween expected payoffs, uncertainty, variance,or other properties of the payoff distributions?That is the question that we are going to answer.There are two general approaches to building models for decisionmaking and uncertainty.Let's call them rational and behavioral.The rational approach, which is whatwe are going to pursue in this class, is prescriptive.It's a model of choice, which gives us consistent decisionsand uncertainty.This internal consistency is desirable.It's basically a way of avoiding costly mistakes.Behavioral approach has a different objective.Rather than figuring out what is the right consistent wayof making decisions, the behavioral approachaims to describe how individuals make decisionsin all of their imperfections.For example, if you're an investor,you're trying to avoid mistakes in your portfolio choice.You would want to use a rational approachto make sure that your own decision making is consistent.If you're a financial advisor thinkingabout how to best advise your clients,you may want to understand what behavioral biases aremost relevant and help the client correct them.If you're a trader, thinking about what other traders aredoing in the market, whoever's takingthe other side of your trade, understanding behavioral biasescould be at the core of your profitability.So we're going to proceed developinga model of consistent decision making,and we'll call it a rational model.Our model is going to make a few basic assumptions.We are going to think about preferences over outcomes only.Outcomes in our case are cash flows.This is important.It's a restriction which could be relaxed.But under the basic model, we aregoing to make this assumption.What this means is that we are goingto think about the value of the pay off--$100, $1,000 payoff.We're not going to think about the circumstances under whichthe payoffs are realized.That is a more general problem.We will also model preferences in a waythat is independent of how cash flows are generated.Randomness may come from many sources.It could be algorithmically generated.It could be a natural outcome of economic forces.At the end, our preferences are goingto be developed to deal with the distribution of cash flowsand not with the mechanism for generating randomness.These are the two basic assumptionsthat we are going to start with.We're going to maintain them.The expected utility theory, whichwe are going to present next, is at the coreof the rational approach to decision making.It's the leading model for decision makingand uncertainty.Under the expected utility theory,investors do not use expected payoffof a gamble to compare gambles to each other.They don't think about just the mean of the return.They don't think about the expected pay offof an investment.They think about the entire distribution.Expected utility theory applies a transformation to the payoff.It's a nonlinear transformation.For example, $1,000 payoff is notgoing to be perceived as twice as valuable as $500.An investor, depending on his or her preferences,is going to adjust the internal valueof each payoff, the utility of each payoff,to reflect their preferences.Once the payoffs are transformed nonlinearly,as you can see in this graph, the probabilities of payoffsare then applied as weights.So under the expected utility theory,an investor evaluates a particular risk investmentbased on the expected utility, where the utility evaluatedas a function of outcomes is averaged using probabilitiesof different events as weights.For example, if you are faced with a binary gambleand the curve presented on the graph,the blue line is the utility function.The gamble has only two possible payoffs, either 1.2 or 2.8,both equally likely.The utility of the payoff is going to be given by the dotin the middle of the segment, connecting the twodots on the utility curve.This is a graphical representationof the expected utility of this particular gamble.An investor transforms payoffs using the utility functionand computes expected value of the utility.That's the starting point.That's the description of uncertaintyand how an investor feels about different risky outcomes.Now, the consistent approach to choiceis to compare risky investments to each otherbased on their expected utility.When thinking about investment a versus investment b,whichever yields higher expected utility is preferred.That is the expected utility theory.This approach is mathematicaly parsimonious.It's fairly intuitive, and it helps avoid costly mistakes.It respects laws of probability.It leads to investment decisions withsome basic desirable properties, such as sensitivity.For example, under the expected utility theory,if an investor prefers x to y and y to z,the same investor will correctly prefer x to z.

INSTRUCTOR: Next, we are going to develop a concept calledrisk aversion, or to be more precise,relative risk aversion.This is the key property of the utilityfunction, which reflects the property of investor behavior.How averse is this investor to risky outcomes?We are going to start with the basic fundamental propertiesof the utility function itself.Some desirable properties.For example, if we want the investor to prefer moreto less, which is very common, mathematically it'sgoing to imply that, when confrontedwith a choice between gamble x or gamblex plus positive epsilon, the investoris going to prefer x plus epsilon.What it means is that to capture preferences like these,preference for more to less, an investorwould have to have an increasing utility function.So far, so good.Utility function has to be increasing.What more can we say about it's shape?As it happens, if an investor is averse to risk,the utility function also has to be concave.Now why is that?Suppose an investor is presented with a risky gamble, x.The choice is, take the risk, play out, gamble x,collect the outcomes.Or receive a sure thing, a pay off without riskequal to the expected value of x.Between x random, expected value of x, sure thing.What would the investor choose?Now most investors are averse to risk.They would rather collect a sure thing,a fixed payoff equal to the expected value of the gamble.Mathematically, it means that the utility functionhas to be concave.If the utility function is concave,then the mean of the gamble is alwayspreferred to the gamble itself.To illustrate the concept of risk aversion graphically,and to see how this is related to concavity of the utilityfunction, look at the graph.The blue line is the utility functionplotted against the outcome of the gamble.This function is concave.Now imagine that we are playing a binary gamble, as before.Two outcomes, 1.2, 2.8.Both outcomes are equally likely.If the investor evaluates this gamble usingthe expected utility model, the expected utilityis going to be seen on the graph as the dot in the middleof the red segment.This is the line connecting two points, utility of 1.2,utility of 2.8.Now this is the expected utility of the random payoff.What if instead, the investor waspresented with the sure thing.The expected value of the gamble.In this case, the expected value is 2.The utility evaluated at the expected value of the gambleis shown as the blue dot on the utility curve.The blue dot, of course, is above the red dot.It has to be, because, the utility function is concave.This is the essence of what a concave function is.So what we can see is that, basedon this graphical representation,it's quite clear that concavity of the utility functionis equivalent to risk aversion in behavior.Now we're going to develop a concept of risk premium.Suppose that an investor is evaluating an investmentstrategy with return x, which is random.And an investor starts with wealth w,invests, and collects a payoff equal to w times 1 plus x.Let's assume that the expected return is 0.And we are going to call the variance of chance sigmax squared.The risk averse investor, of course,would prefer to receive a 0 return for sure,a risk-free return of 0, rather than playing this gamble.Rather than making this investment.Now we are going to define the concept of risk premiumas a number, pi.It's a fixed number, it's not a random variable.Such that an investor would be indifferent between collectinga return of minus pi or investinginto a strategy with the risk return x.To determine what pi is, how it reflectsthe properties of the utility functionand the risk of the gamble, we needto think about investors' preferences.Being indifferent between investinginto an asset with a random returnx versus getting a sure risk-free return of minus pimeans mathematically that expected utilityof w times 1 plus x is equal to the utility evaluatedat w times 1 minus pi, which is a riskless return of minus pi.To analyze this equation further,we need to make some approximations.We are going to use a Taylor expansion to simplifythe problem.So to start with, let's assume thatthe range of outcomes of this gamble--the support of the return x--is relatively narrow.So that the range of possible outcomes of xis concentrated somewhere around 0.Let's say between minus and plus epsilon whereepsilon is a small number.If that is the case, then there is premium,pi, is going to be small in magnitude as well,which allows us to use a Taylor expansionto approximate the problem.With this idea in mind, we're goingto expand both sides of the equation around 0.Let's start with the left-hand side.Expected utility of w times 1 plus x.We are going to expand it around x equal to 0.First, let's expand the utility function under the expectation.We are going to keep three leading terms in the expansion.First, utility of w.Then the margin utility, u prime,evaluated to w times w times x.That's the linear term in the Taylor expansion.Then comes the second order, a quadratic term.1/2 of the second derivative of u times wsquared times x squared.When we take the expected value of this expression,we are left with utility of w u prime times w timesthe expected value of x, which by assumption is 0, plus--and here is the important term--1/2 of the second derivative of u,times w squared times the variance of the return,which is sigma x squared.This is the approximation of the left-hand side.The expected utility of the risk to return.On the right-hand side, we have the utilityof w times 1 minus pi, which we also expand.Here, we only need to keep the two leading terms, 0 orderand the first order.We end up with u of w minus u prime times w times pi.We end up with inequality.On the left-hand side, we have an approximate expressionfor the expected utility of the risky investment.On the right-hand side, it's the utility of w times 1 minus pi,the certainty equivalent, which defines the risk premium.When we solve this equation, we see that the risk premiumis given by minus 1/2 times the ratio of the second derivativeof the utility function times w divided by u prime of wtimes sigma x squared.We see that the risk premium is a product of two objects.The first is what we call relative risk aversioncoefficient.This is minus w times the second derivativeof the utility function divided by the first derivative.This object captures what we knowis the curvature of the utility function.If the utility function were to be a straight line,the second derivative would be 0.Relative risk aversion would be 0.For a properly concave utility function,this number is positive.The second piece, the second term, in the risk premiumis the measure of return risk.In this case, we see that its return variance.The conclusion is that the risk premiumthat investor demands, based on the riskiness of the gambleof the investment strategy, and basedon his or her own preferences, is comprised of two terms.Investor's relative risk aversion,which is the property of the utility function,and return variance, which is the measure of return risk.Let's consider a couple of examples of utility functions.First, the simplest case is a linear utility.In this case, u of w is an affine function of w.Linear utility is special because it implies0 relative risk aversion.An investor with linear utility does not care about risk.This kind of investor is going to evaluate each investmentopportunity based on the expected value of the return.The second example of the utility functionthat we want to introduce is the so-called power utilityfunction.It's also called constant relative risk aversion.We will see in a second why this name.A power utility function is given by a power functionof investor's wealth.And its coefficient is a positive number.The case of the coefficient equal to 1 is special.In this case, the utility function becomes logarithmic.The key property of the power utility function,and the reason why it's so commonly used,is that the relative risk aversioncoefficient of this utility function is constant.It's equal to the exponent in the power,and it's independent of the level of wealth.The implication of this is that an investor following a powerutility function is going to have the same riskaversion, regardless of the level of wealth.Which means that making an investment decisionwith a million dollars or 5 or 10,this investor is going to choose the same portfolioof investments.The level of initial wealth doesn't effect the choice.

PROFESSOR: Next, we are going to introducea special class of preferences calledthe mean-variance preferences.These preferences are very important.They are at the core of the modern portfolio theory.They're highly tractable.And we are going to base a large partof our discussion of portfolio choiceon this model of preferences.Let's assume that returns on all investmentsare normally distributed.This means that for any investmentwe are willing to consider, the distribution of the returnsis Gaussian with the investment-specific meanand variance.Let's call them r bar and sigma squaredfor a particular investment under consideration.An investor, following the expected utility model,is going to rank investments basedon their expected utility.Let's compute expected utility of a normally distributedreturn.It's going to be a function of the two moments--the mean and the variance.As a result, this investor is goingto evaluate each investment using only these two moments--the average return, the mean of the investment return,and the second moment, the variance of the return.Hence, the name mean-variance preferences.Variance of returns, or standard deviation,which is the square root, is the only measureof risk under this model.And an investor compares all investmentsbased on their two key properties, the first twomoments.We should note that this model of preferences is special.It applies to many situations.It produces useful results, but it's not the complete story.It is, however, an important starting point.And it is very widely used.Now, the graph that you see helpsus visualize investor preferencesby plotting the indifference curves in the space of riskand expected return.In this case, we will think of riskas the standard deviation of returns, which isplotted on the horizontal axis.And expected returns are on the vertical axis.The curves that you see, the blues curves,represent indifference curves correspondingto a particular set of mean-variance preferences.What this means is that the investor that you'rethinking about is indifferent between any twopoints on the same curve.Moving in the vertical direction meansincreasing the expected return.Moves us from one indifference curve to the nextand to the next.So moving up is going to lead to higherlevels of expected utility.Moving to the left means reducing risk.This, again, leads to higher levels of expected utility.When evaluating investment decisions,an investor with mean-variance preferenceswill prefer investments that are representedby points as far as possible in the Northwest direction basedon the shape of the indifference curves.

We will now discuss the basic properties of asset returns.We will look at some empirical datato get a sense of the level of risk and returnin different asset classes, how they're related to each other.Let's begin with some notation.For any investment, the initial price, P0, is known.The terminal price, P1, at the end of the period, is random.It's unknown.A period could be a month, a quarter, a year,whatever is relevant for a given context.At the end of the period, there are additional cash flowsthat investment produces.Let's call them dividends.They're also random.As a result, the total return on the investmentduring the period, we call it R1,is given by the dividend plus the capital gains, whichis P1 minus P0, divided by the initial valueof the investment.So the total return comes from capital gainsand the dividends.Or more precisely the dividend yield,which is the ratio of D1 to P0.The expected return is just the expected value of the return.It's equal to the expected dividend plus expected terminalprice divided by the initial price minus 1.It is common to use the concept of excess returns.Excess returns are typically measured in relationto the risk-free rate.As the name suggests, excess returnis the return in excess of the risk-free rate.So for each investment return, wecan subtract the risk-free rate, and we obtaina measure of excess returns.We will now introduce several basic statisticsthat are commonly used to describethe properties of returns.Under the framework of mean variance preferences,these are also the building blocksof how we describe preferences over different investmentstrategies.They capture the average returns and return risk, or variance.In particular, we'll talk about investment return mean, r bar,the variance, sigma squared, and the standard deviation,which is sigma.Standard deviation is commonly called volatility of returns.These moments, which form the basis of preferencesunder the mean variance framework,are not known in practice.They need to be estimated.They can be estimated using statistical techniquesbased on historical data.The most common estimators-- the most basic estimators--corresponding to these population momentsare the sample mean, which corresponds to the populationmean or average return.The sample variance, which is 1 divided by the samplesize minus 1 times the sum of squared deviations of returnsfrom their sample mean.And the square root of the sample varianceis the sample standard deviation.These are the most commonly used statisticsthat we are going to employ now to describethe properties of financial returns in the data.Let's look at a few examples of the major asset classesand their properties, their average returns,and their standard deviations.In particular, we are going to look at the history of returnsstarting in 1926.We will use annual data, and we'll be using nominal returns.The least risky investment in our table are the T-bills.This is as close as it comes to the risk-free rate in practice.And the T-bills have low volatility and low returns.The reason why they have any volatility at allis because the risk-free rate changes over time.It is not constant year to year.Next in terms of the level of risk come bonds.Treasury bonds and corporate bonds.Their average returns are roughly twice as highas for T-bills, and their level of volatility is quite a bithigher, in the 8% to 10% range.Stocks are even more volatile than bonds.Volatility of stocks is in a 20% to 30% range.And it's important to understand what we mean by that.We are thinking about portfolios of stocks,either large cap stocks.This is a portfolio of companies with large marketcapitalization.Or small caps, portfolio of stocks with a low marketcapitalization.These portfolios are the most volatile in our table.They have the highest volatility, 20%, 30%,and perhaps higher.And their average returns in sample are 12% to 17%.What we can see from this table is a patternthat suggests that when we compare different assetclasses to each other, higher returns comewith higher levels of risk.This is a casual observation.We need to learn how to better modelthe relation between risk and return,but this is the starting point.There is no free lunch.In order to achieve high levels of returns,investors have to accept high levels of risk.Now, the graph here represents visuallyhow quickly different investments allow oneto accumulate wealth.There are several lines here.Imagine you start with $100 at the end of the year in 1925.You invest in a particular asset, T-bills, bonds, stocks.And you keep rolling over your investment over time.How quickly would your wealth accumulate?As we can see from this graph, thereis in an order of magnitude difference between outcomesat the end of this exercise, roughly a century later.Investments in bonds, long-term treasury bondsor corporate bonds, produced significantly higher levelsof wealth compared to T-bills.Large cap stocks do even better, an order of magnitude higherlevel of wealth.Small cap stocks as an investment strategydo even better than that.This raises a question.Why would any investor want to investin bonds when, in the long run, stocks perform so much better?The answer lies in the risk return trade off.Investing in stocks, in order to achieve high levels of returns,comes with a much higher level of risk.It is because of this risk returntrade off that all of these investments can coexist.For some investors, stocks are more appealing.Those investors have higher tolerance towards risk.They are able to achieve higher levels of reward, higherlevels of expected returns.For more conservative investors with lower levelsof risk tolerance, investing in bonds,which are safer investments, is more appealing.

PROFESSOR: We will now talk about other dimensionsof return risk.We will try to think outside of the mean variance framework.For an investor, properties of returns other than returnvariance could be important.In particular, we can think about such momentsas skewness and kurtosis.Skewness is a property of the return distributionthat measures its asymmetry.A distribution that skew to the rightwill have the property that large positive outcomesare more likely than large negative outcomes.Similarly, if you'll think about negative skewness,then large negative outcomes are morelikely than large positive.Skewness is particularly importantwhen dealing with non-linear investment instrumentssuch as derivatives.For investment strategies involving derivatives,return distribution is often highly skewedand as a result mean various preferences do not completelycapture all dimensions of risk thatare relevant for the investor.Kurtosis is another feature of the distribution.It captures the measure of heavy tails, of fat tails.A distribution with a high level of kurtosishas the property that extreme outcomes on the rightor on the left are both relatively likely.In particular, they're more likely thanunder the normal distribution.When we think about an investment strategywith a high degree of kurtosis, wehave to worry about the high likelihoodof these outcomes which is an important dimension of risk.We also need to think about modeling risk.If a distribution has fat tails, the properties of distribution,such as the mean and the variance,are relatively difficult to estimate.In the following table, we compare return moments, mean,and standard deviation of two exchange traded funds.First, let me remind you what the exchange traded funds are.These are securities that trade just like stocks,and underneath these securities are portfolios,investment strategies, that followa relatively simple recipe.These are funds, they're portfolios,but they trade as stocks.They're very convenient and increasingly popularinvestment vehicles.We are looking at two types of funds in this exercise.One is an equity fund with the ticker symbol SPY.This is a fund that tracks on S&P 500 index.The second fund is a bond fund, this is a bond ETF,with the ticker symbol AGG and this fundtracks a portfolio of bonds.The average returns over the past decade or soare around 0.7% for SPY and around 0.3% for AGG.In the table, you could see the average returnsand the standard deviation of returnsat the monthly frequency starting in January of 2008.The takeaway here is that the equity ETF, SPY, is much morevolatile than the bond ETF.The ratio volatilities is practical a four to one.Next, let's take a closer look at the distribution of returnson one of these funds.We're looking at the bond fund here.As we can see from this graph, thereis a large outcome on the right.When we evaluate the likelihood of this outcomeunder the normal distribution with the same varianceas the historical distribution of returns on this ETF,we find that this observation whichhappens to come from December of 2008is approximately 5.8 standard deviations away from the mean.If you recall, December of '08, it was right in the middleof the great financial crisis.How likely is this kind of observation?Under the normal distribution whilewould have to wait on average 10 million yearsin order to see a draw of returns like this.What this analysis tells us is that the distributionof returns on the bond ETF is very far from normal.This is an example of high kurtosis.These types of outcomes are extremelyrare under the normal model, yet we do see themin the financial data series.High kurtosis is a common feature in financial markets.Properties of asset returns are not constant.They change over time.This is very important to recognizewhen modeling the distribution of returns statistically.It also helps us understand some of the properties of returns,such as high likelihood of extreme outcomes,high kurtosis relative to the normal distribution.Let's take a closer look at the exchange traded fund.This fund tracks a portfolio of high yield bonds.The ticker symbol is HYG.Again, we're looking at the time series starting in 2008.What we see from the graph is a pretty clear periodof high volatility in the early part of the sample.This is the crisis period of '08 and '09.This is not surprising.As we know from history, this was the periodof significant dislocation in financial markets, creditmarkets in particular.As a result, fixed income investment strategiessuch as those represented by this type of fundwere extremely volatile.During this period, there were many monthswith high draws of returns, either large positive returnsor large negative returns.To be specific, we observed five month with returnsexceeding three standard deviations in magnitude.And that happened in a span of a single year.This should be extremely unlikelyunder the normal distribution with constant volatility.Of course, the point here is that volatility is notconstant.This early period produced so many large observationsof returns precisely reflecting the factthat the market volatility was relatively high.What this example illustrates is that itis important to model time variationin near-term volatility in order to havea realistic model of risk.Risk is time varying.

PROFESSOR: Having discussed the properties of individual assetreturns, we will now talk about the joint distributionof returns.How can we describe interdependenceof different financial assets?The core concept here is correlation-- correlationof returns.It is a measure of dependence.It's a linear measure.It's not the only possible way of describing how returnsare related to each other.But it's a leading statistic that's very commonly used.We start with the covariance of returns.A covariance is defined mathematicallyas the expected value of the product of the differencesbetween returns on asset i and its mean and assetj and its mean.The correlation is just the covarianceof returns, normalized by the product of standard deviations.What this statistic captures is to what degree two assetsco-move with each other.When correlation is high, close to 1,both assets tend to go up and down in unison.When correlation is close to minus 1,they tend to move in the opposite directionfrom each other.When correlation is zero, there is no linear relationbetween the two assets at all.A closely related concept is the beta of returns.The beta is the ratio of the covariance between returnson asset i and asset j and the variance of returns on asset j.The concept of beta is very important.We are going to come back to it.But intuitively, what the beta representsis the degree to which returns on asset jaffect statistically returns on asset i.When beta is equal to 1, for each 1% movement in asset j,we would see on average 1% movement in asset i.When we plot returns on one assetversus the other as a scatter plot,beta is given by the slope of the regression line.The following graph provides a visual illustrationof how joint distributions may look with positive, negative,or zero correlation.What you see in the top left corneris a scatter plot of the joint distributionof returns on two assets with zero correlation.It looks like a ball of points.There is no obvious linear relation between the two.On the right, we see two examplesof imperfect correlation, a positive and negative.At the top, correlation is positive.It's equal to 0.5.We see, visually, a clear positive relation between twoassets, which is not perfect.There is a lot of deviation from the 45 degree line.But nonetheless, it's clear the two assets, on average,move together in a positive direction.Below that is a graph correspondingto the correlation of minus 0.5.Now, we see that the typical relation between the two assetsis negative.When one of them goes up, the other one tends to decline.At the bottom on the left, we see an examplewith a high degree of positive correlation.Now it is 0.8.We see that the points now fall very close to the 45 degreeline, indicating that most of the movementis now highly related between the two assets.There is very little individual variation.Next, let's look at a couple of empirical examplesshowing us the degree of correlationbetween different kinds of financial assets.On the left, we have a scatter plotillustrating the joint distributionof returns on two stocks.One is Intel.The other one is IBM.Both of these are large technology stocks.What we see from this graph is a clear senseof positive relation between the two.These two returns are positively correlated.This is not surprising and, in fact, fairly typical.Stocks that are economically related to each otherwill tend to have positive correlation.On the right, we see a scatter plotof two exchange traded funds.We encountered them earlier--the bond fund, AGG, and the stock fund, SPY.It's a different picture.We now see that the distribution of points on the scatter plotdoes not show an obvious linear relation.The scatter plot looks like a random cloud of points.And the regression line is relatively flat.In this case, correlation between the two assetsis very close to zero.Stocks and bonds have a low degree of correlation.This is an important empirical factand forms the basis of long-term investment strategiesdiversifying risk between stocks and bonds.We will come back to the concept of diversificationlater in this class.Let's take a look at a broader patternof correlations among different types of financial assets.In the table, we'll look at pair-wise correlationsbetween stocks, bonds, treasury bills, and inflation.We see that closely related assetstend to have high levels of correlation.For instance, when we look at large cap stocks and small capstocks, we observe correlations around 80%.Different types of equities tend to co-move with each other.Corporate bonds and Treasury bondsalso show a high degree of co-movement, over 80%.Stocks versus long-term Treasuries,as we have seen before, don't have a lot of co-movement.And their correlation with each other is close to zero.Treasury bills tend to have positive correlationwith inflation.It's not terribly high, but it's in the neighborhood of 40%.The reason for that is that the nominal returnon Treasury bills has an inflation component.And that induces a positive correlation between the two.So far, we looked at the pair-wise correlationsbetween financial assets.We think of these as cross-sectional correlations,how returns are related to each other at a point in time.Another important dimension is time-series correlationor order correlation.This concept applies to a single asset over time.We are now looking at how returnsduring different periods are related to each other.The empirical fact in financial marketsis that there is not a lot of serial correlation in returns.Autocorrelation, or serial correlation,of returns on most assets is very close to zero.This is the case for stocks and long-term bonds.The reason for that has to do with the factthat high degree of serial correlationwould imply that it is relatively easy to forecastfuture returns by observing past returns;the two are closely related.Being able to predict returns in risky assetswould then enable one to design highly profitable tradingstrategies.These are difficult to come by.As a result, the implication is that one should notobserve high levels of autocorrelationin returns, particularly at high frequency-- daily,weekly, or monthly.The following figure illustrates the point.We are now looking at the monthly returns on a stock.It's a stock of IBM.And the scatter plot shows returnsin any given month against returns in the previous month.We see that there is no clear linear pattern on this graph.And in fact, the empirical estimate of the autocorrelationover this period, which starts at the beginning of '08, isclose to minus 6%.There is not a lot of autocorrelationin returns on this stock or most other risky investments.

PROFESSOR: We will now introduce basic elementsof portfolio analytics.In particular, we'll introduce conceptsof leverage and margin.First, let's define a portfolio.A portfolio is a collection of assets, risky or risk free.The portfolio is defined by its composition--how many shares of each security are held in the portfolio.In terms of notation, we are goingto denote the total portfolio value by V.And this value is going to be equal to the sum of investmentsin each of the securities in the portfolio.Each of the investments is valuedas the number of shares times the market price.So the total portfolio value V is equal to the sum,across all of the positions in the portfolio,of the product of the price Pi and the number of shares Ni.The composition of the portfolio can alsobe described by portfolio weights.The weight on each investment is definedas the ratio of the value of the position, normalizedby the value of the portfolio.It's the ratio of Ni times Pi, whichis the value of the position over V,the value of the portfolio.For this definition to make sense,the value of the portfolio cannot be 0.In fact, typically, the value is positive.There are, however, some portfolios for whichthe value V could be 0.We call these arbitrage portfolios.An arbitrage portfolio is special.It does not require a positive investment.For every long position in the portfolio,there has to be a short position so that the total investmentinto the portfolio is 0.For a typical portfolio, V is positive.Portfolio weights, in this case, are well defined.And by definition, they have to add up to 1.So the sum of W1 plus W2 and so forthacross all of the positions in the portfoliois always equal to 1.As an example, consider a portfolioof three securities, A, B, and C,with a total investment of $100,000.Suppose that we buy 200 shares of assets A,1,000 shares of asset B, and 750 shares of asset C.You can see the relevant data in the table.You can see the number of shares in each position,the price per share, which is $50 for A, $60 for B,and $40 for C, and the total investment into each security.The total investment is equal to the number of sharestimes the share price.For example, for asset A, it's 200 shares at $50 per share.It's $10,000.It's $60,000 for asset B and $30,000 for asset C.So the total investment is $100,000.You can see, in the column on the right, portfolio weights.As we said before, portfolio weightis defined as the ratio of the value of each positionto the total value of the portfolio.For A, it's going to be 10,000 dividedby 100,000, which is 10%.It's 60% for B and 30% for C. By definition, these weights sumup to 1 or 100%.Now, suppose your broker informs youthat you could, in fact, maintain the same portfoliowith less capital.Let's say, you could reduce your capital investmentto $50,000 from $100,000.How can you achieve that?You need to use margin.You could borrow money at the risk-free rateto buy risky assets in the portfolio.In our particular example, in orderto buy $100,000 worth of stocks startingwith $50,000 in capital, you wouldneed to borrow $50,000 at the risk-free rate.This changes the portfolio composition.If you now look at the table, yousee that we have a new row, which correspondsto the risk-free bond.The investment into the bond is negative,which means that we are borrowing $50,000.The investment in each of the stocks is the same as before.We're establishing the same portfolio.The portfolio weights, however, now change.The reason is that while the investment into eachof the securities, A, B, and C, is the same as before,the total value of the portfolio in the denominatoris now $50,000 and not $100,000, whichdoubles the weight on each of the risky assets.It is now 20% invested in A rather than 10%,120% in B rather than 60%, and 60% in C instead of 30%.When we sum up portfolio weights across the risky assetsplus minus 100% invested in the risk-free bond,the total of the weights is again 100%.Another example of a portfolio that is commonly usedcan be seen in buying real estate.Imagine that you're buying a house.The value of the house is $500,000.You make an initial investment of $100,000, whichis 20% of the house value.These ratios are typical for the US residential market.The remaining $400,000 need to be borrowed.And they could be borrowed by obtaininga mortgage on the home.As a result, a buyer of the househas a portfolio with two positions--$500,000 of real estate, which is the value of the house,and a negative position of $400,000, whichrepresents the mortgage.This is the amount of money that the buyer owes to the bank.The total net value of the investment,which has developed the portfolio, V, is $100,000.It's the sum of the two positions.If we now compute portfolio weights,we see that the weight of the house--the weight of the real estate in the portfolio-- is plus 500%.And the weight of the mortgage, which is a loan, is minus 400%.The total, again, is 1, 100%.The ratio of the asset value to the net investmentis what we call leverage.That's the leverage ratio.In our example of buying a house, the asset is the house.The net investment is $100,000, whichis what the buyer of the home invests into this property.The ratio of the asset value to the net investmentis 500 over 100, which is 5.That's the leverage ratio of this transaction.Leverage magnifies movements in the asset value.It scales up gains as well as losses.For example, suppose that the house value declines by 15%.A cash buyer would have seen a 15% declinein the total value of the portfolio.Someone who uses a mortgage is goingto see a much larger decline.In fact, it's going to be 5 times as large, 75%.To see that, let's compute the decline in the asset value.$500,000-- that's the value of the initial investment--declines by $75,000, which is 15%.Following the decline of 15%, the value of the houseis now $425,000.With the initial investment of $100,000and the mortgage of $400,000, thismeans that the buyer of the houseis left with a total of $25,000.That is a $75,000 decline, or a 75% declinerelative to the initial investment.

PROFESSOR: We will now talk about risk and returnin portfolio investments.In particular, we will introduce the core conceptof this lecture, diversification.When forming your portfolio, why notpick the best asset among many possible investments?There are many problems with this idea.One is, of course, it's hard to tell which stock is the best.It is also the case that by forminga portfolio of multiple investments,one can achieve a better risk return trade offthan by picking one asset over another.That is the benefit of diversification,something we are going to discussin detail in this segment.One can use a portfolio to enhance performanceby focusing one's bets.This could be achieved by hedging.For example, suppose that you havea view on a particular company.Your view is on the quality of firms managementor on its opportunities in the marketplace.If you want to place a bet on a company,you are, in fact, betting on much morethan your initial view.You are betting on broad market movesto which the stock is exposed.By taking additional positions, for example,by taking a short position in the market,you will be able to isolate your bet.So that you are betting on stock specific performancerather than on that plus additional movementsin the market.So forming portfolios could be very usefulin order to isolate views on particular elementsof the trade.Portfolios can be used to customize and manage risks.This is an important part of the risk management process.They could be used to tailor a risk return trade offto the needs of the particular investor.How do we go about choosing the best portfolio?Now, first of all, we have to say, what is the best mean?This is subjective.What we want to do is to find the portfolio thatis the best for a particular investor givenhis or her preferences.This process is an optimization processamong all possible portfolios.We are going to look at the one thatmaximizes the investor's objective,such as expected utility.This means that before we form a portfolio,we need to agree on what the objective is.What are we trying to optimize?Which properties of the portfolio are important?Now, in the mean variance framework,there are two aspects of the portfolio that matter.One is the expected return.Investors prefer higher expected returns.The other important dimension is risk.Investors prefer lower risk, and in particular, riskis measured by variance of portfolio returns.Expected return on the portfolio, as well asthe variance of returns, are determinedby the composition of the portfolio, whichis the collection of weights on individual investmentsand by the properties of the individual investmentsthemselves.In particular, when we think about the portfolio averagereturn, portfolio mean return, itis based on the average returns of individual assetsand portfolio weights.If we have put together expected returnson individual investments into a vector from one to N,call each of the elements R bar, whichrepresents the expected return on eachof the stocks in the portfolio.Then the expected return on the portfoliois a sum over all of the positions of the expectedreturn on an individual asset times the portfolioweight of that asset.In other words, the expected return on the portfoliois a weighted average of the individual expected returns.For portfolio variance, it's a bit more involved.First, let's summarize the informationabout the properties of the individual investments.This is no longer a vector, but a matrix.It's the co-variance matrix.The diagonal elements of this matrixsummarize riskiness of individual securities.They are given by the variance of security returns.The off diagonal elements, which will turn outto be very important when we talk about diversificationcapture co-movements of investments with each other.They capture co-variance, pair-wise co-varianceof assets in the portfolio.As an example, let's consider a portfolio of two assets.One is a ETF SPY.It's an equity ETF.The other is a bond ETF.We have seen these two securities before.In the following two tables, you could see historical estimatesof average returns on the two securities,as well as their variance co-variance matrix.The variance co-variance matrix is not easy to read.It is more intuitive to present informationas volatilities of individual investments,as well as their relations with each other.As we have seen before, investment in SPYhas much higher volatility than the bond ETF investment,and correlation between these two securitiesis very close to zero.Now, let's take a close look at the expected returnon the portfolio.As we said before, they expected return on the portfoliois a weighted average of expectedreturns on the securities in the portfolio.Let's see why that is the case.We will do that by following a simple example.Again, two securities, SPY and AGG.Suppose that we invest $600 into the equity ETF and $400into the bond ETF.It's $1,000 investment in total, and the portfolio weightsare 0.6 on SPY and 0.4 on AGG respectively.Suppose that over the next month, the return on SPYhappens to be 2% and a return on the bond ETF AGG is minus 1%.Keep in mind that these are realized returnsover a particular month.These are not expected values.What is the total return on the portfolio?We can see that the portfolio value is going to change,and the change is going to be equal to the sum of changesin the values of the individual positions.The investment in SPY is going to increase by 2%, whichis going to be equal to $12.The investment in AGG is going to declineby 1%, which is a $4 decline.The total increase is $8 over 1,000,which gives us 0.8% return on the entire portfolio.What this illustrates is that the return on the portfoliois equal to the weighted average of returnson the individual positions.Once we know how the return on the portfoliois related to the returns on the individual investments,we can compute the expected portfolio returnand the variance of the return.The expected portfolio return is an expected valueof the weighted average of individual asset returns, whichends up being the weighted average of expected returnson the investments in the portfolio.The unexpected component of the returncan be computed by subtracting the portfolio return meanfrom the realized return.Portfolio return variance is the varianceof the weighted average of the individual security returns.Using the formula for the variance,we see that this amounts to summing upelements of the matrix that you see presented here,where the diagonal elements of the matrixare individual variances multipliedby the squares of security weights in the portfolio.And the off diagonal elements are co-variancesof asset returns multiplied by the productof the corresponding weights.In case of two assets in the portfolio,we end up with three terms, two diagonal terms, whichcapture the contribution of individual return variances,and the off diagonal terms, whichare identical to each other and capture the contributionof the co-movement between the two assets in the portfolio.Going back to our original example of a two assetportfolio of SPY and AGG, let's assumethat the weights on the two securitiesare equal to each other, W1 equal to W2 equal to 1/2.In this case, the expected portfolio returnis an arithmetic average of the expected returns on the twosecurities.A portfolio mean is always a weighted averageof individual return means.Next, we compute the volatility of portfolio returns.For our portfolio of SPY and AGG,we find that the portfolio volatility is, in fact, lessthan the weighted average of the individual volatilitiesof returns.This is an example of portfolio diversification.Volatility of the portfolio is not a simple weighted averageof individual volatilities, and by combining securitiestogether, one can achieve a significant reduction in risk.What enables us to do that is the imperfectcorrelation between returns and the individual positionsin the portfolio.We now extend our results to the general case,a portfolio of M assets.This is analogous to the two assets portfolio.Except now, we have a longer sum of terms,and the expressions are general.The portfolio return as before is a weighted averageof individual asset returns.The portfolio mean is a weighted averageof mean returns on individual assets in the portfolio,and the variance of the portfolio return is a sum.It's a double sum over all assets in the portfolio,and each element of the sum is givenby the product of security weights, WI and WJ for assets Iand J, times the co-variance between their returns.If you look closely at the portfolio variance,we see that it can be decomposed into two types of terms.The diagonal terms capture the contributionof their own variance of each of the positions,and the off diagonal terms that are driven by co-variances.

PROFESSOR: In this question, we will practice the conceptof expected utility.Let's start with a very simple example.We have the following investor with utility functionsquare root of x.And this investor is offered the following two choices,receive $1,000 with probability 1,or participate in the following lottery,lottery A, which with probability 1/2 pays $1,100,and with the remaining probability, 1/2, pays $900.So the question is, this investor,with this utility function, which of the following twochoices she prefers.What I have done here is, I've writtenexpected utility of this investor for this lotteryand for this sure payoff.Let's start with the lottery.The expected utility of this investorequals to 1/2 the utility of the payment in the first outcome,which is $1,100, plus another 1/2 times the utility of $900.This is the second outcome.So this is the utility from these payoffs weightedby the probability of these two outcomes.So our utility function is just the square root function.So this first part becomes 1/2 multipliedby square root of $1,100.The second part becomes 1/2 multipliedby the square root of $900.So if we compute this, I get $31.58.Now, in this first choice, which is the short payoff of $1,000,the expected utility is just the utility of this $1,000,because this is a certain outcome.Which equals to-- again, given our utility function,this equals to the square root of $1,000.And this equals to $31.62.Now, which of the two these investor picks?Well let's figure out which of the two optionsgives us higher expected utility.The expected utility of the first option is $31.62.The expected utility of the second option is $31.58.Since $31.62 is greater than $31.58,this investor should go for this first choice,which is the certain outcome.Now, the reason for this choice hereis that we're dealing with a risk averse investor.If we compare the expected payoffof the first option and the second option,they are the same.The expected payoff for the first optionis just literally $1,000.The expected payoff of the second option is also $1,000.It's 1/2 times the first pay of $1,100 plus the other 1/2 times$900.This is the payoff in the second state of the world.So the average of the two is just $1,000.So the expected pay of the first optionis exactly the same as the expectedpay of the second option but there is more uncertaintyof the second option.And since we're dealing with the risk-averse investor, whohas a concave utility function, this investorgoes for a certain outcome with exactlythe same expected payoff as less certain outcomeswith the same expected payoff.

#### 415-1x_Rec 06_Q1, Part B-en

PROFESSOR: Now in the second part of the question,we have the same investor with the same utility function.But now, she has a choice between the following twolotteries.Lottery A is the same exact lotterywe had in the first part of this question,and Lottery B. So a Lottery A with probability 1/2pays $1,100 and probably 1/2 pays $900.Now lottery B with probability 1/2pays $1,250, with probability 1/2 pays $750.Now the question is which of these two lotteriesthis investor will choose.Now let's compute the expected utility that this investor willget from Lottery A and Lottery B.We've already done this calculation for Lottery A.So the expected utility equals to 1/2 the utility of $1,100plus the other half utility of $900.This gave us 31.58.Now let's do the same calculation for Lottery B.So the expected utility equals to 1/2 utilityof $1,250 plus the other half utility of $750.So the utility function, again, is the square root function.So it's 1/2 square root of $1,250plus 1/2 square root of $750.That gives us 31.37.So given these two expected utilities,which of the two lotteries our investor prefers?Well, since Lottery A gives her a higher expected utilitycompared to Lottery B, then this investoris going to prefer Lottery A to Lottery B.The reason for this choice is exactly the same reasonas we had in the previous part of this question.Both of these lotteries A and B offerthe same exact expected payoff.So it's $1,000 in both cases.You could see the symmetry of these outcomes.However, there is more uncertaintyand more risk in the Lottery B because the outcomeis more dispersed.So it's $1,250 or $750 while the first one is either$1,100 or $900.And just because this investor is, again, risk averse,his utility function is concave, this investorwould prefer to take less risky lotterythat offers the same expected payoff.And so therefore, she chooses Lottery Ain this particular case.

#### 415-1x_Rec 06_Q1, Part C-en

PROFESSOR: We have learned in this questionhow to work with expected utilities.To summarize, for any risk-averse investor, anyonewith concave utility function, if thereis a choice between lotteries thatoffer the same expected payoff, a risk-averse investorwill always prefer the less risky lottery.

#### 415-1x_Rec 06_Q2, Part A-en

PROFESSOR: In this question, we willlearn how to find certainty equivalentfor an investor with a given utility function,and for a given lottery or for a given investment opportunity.You are given the following lottery.With probably 0.1, the payoff is $80,000.With probability 0.3, the payoff is $20,000.And with probably 0.6, the payoff is $5,000.If the investor has utility function u of x equal to x,what is the riskless payoff that wouldmake her different between choosingthis particular lottery and the riskless payoff?Then part b of this question gives youan investor with a different utility function, whichis u of x equals x raised to the power of 1 over 2,and asks you the same question.And part c of this question gives you yet another investorwith utility function u of x equals to x raisedto the power of 1 over 3.In this question, we ask to find what in economics we referredto as a certainty equivalent.Let me define what it is.Certainty equivalent is the smallest riskless payoff amountthat makes an investor indifferent between takinga risky lottery or accepting this certain amount.Mathematically, our utility from certainty equivalentor from this guaranteed riskless payoffshould equal to the expected utilitythat we'll get from engaging into this risky lotteryor risky investment.To find certainty equivalent for an investorwith a given utility function in a given lottery,we need to do the following two steps.Step number 1, find expected utility of investorfrom this given lottery.And step 2, find certainty equivalentby inverting the utility function.Let's find certainty equivalent for investorin part a, investor with a linear utility function.So step 1 is to find expected utility that this investor willget from this lottery.We have already learned how to do this in question number 1of this recitation.So the expected utility of this investor equals to 0.1 timesthe utility of the first payoff, whichwas $80,000, plus the probability of the second statetimes the utility that we get of the payoff in the second state,that's $20,000, plus the third probability or the probabilityof the third state, multiplied by the utility of the payoffthat we get in this third state.Since the utility function is linear,this just becomes 0.1 multiplied by 80,000plus 0.3 multiplied by 20,000, plus 0.6 multiplied by 5,000.Computing this gives us the expected utility of 17,000.So this is the expected utility of this investorfrom this given lottery.Now in step 2, we can find certainty equivalent.The utility of the certainty equivalentwould equal to $17,000.In the case of this investor, shehas a linear utility function.So u of CE, which is equal to CE.And so therefore, certainty equivalent for this investoris just 17,000.So therefore, this investor is indifferent between justtaking guaranteed $17,000, this is our certainty equivalent,or playing this lottery.

#### 415-1x_Rec 06_Q2, Part B-en

Let's find certainty equivalent for the second investor.Recall that her utility function is square root of x,or x raised to the power 1/2.Let's do the same two steps as we have donein part a of this question.So step 1, we'll find the expected utilityof this lottery for this investor.We're starting with exactly the same equation.The only difference right now is that utility functionis different.So therefore, where we had 80,000 before,it's going to be 80,000 raised to the power of 1/2.So the full expression looks like this,0.1 multiplied by 80,000 raise to the power of 1/2plus 0.3 multiplied by 20,000 raised to the power 1/2plus 0.6 multiplied by 5,000 raised to the power of 1/2.So computing this gives us expected utilitythat this investor will get from this lottery of 113.14.Now, in the second step, we can find certainty equivalent.So u of CE equals to 113.14.Now, for this investor, u of CE equalsto CE raised to the power 1/2.And so now we have to solve the following equation.So CE raised to the power of 1/2 equals to 113.14.This is a simple equation to solve.So this gives us CE equals to 113.14 raised to the power 2.Computing this gives us 12,800.So therefore, this investor is indifferent between taking$12,800 and playing this lottery.So in other words, her certainty equivalent,or the riskless amount that she'swilling to trade instead of playing this lottery,is $12,800.

#### 415-1x_Rec 06_Q2, Part C-en

Finally, let's find certain equivalentfor the third investor.Recall that this investor has utility function x raisedto the power of 1 over 3.We will do exactly the same two stepsas we have done in the part a and part b of this question.So Step 1, we're starting with the same equation.The only difference right now willbe that the utility function is differentand so therefore $80,000 will haveto be raised to the power of 1 over 3.So $20,000 will have to be raisedto the same power, 1 over 3.And $5,000 will have to be raisedto the power of 1 over 3.Computing this gives us expected utilityfor this investor of 22.71.And now in Step 2, we can find certainty equivalent.So we need to solve this equation.So u of CE equals to 22.71.u of CE equals to CE raised to the power of 1 over 3.Because this is just our utility function.That equals to 22.71.So therefore CE equals to 22.71 raised to the power of 1/3.And this equals to 11,715.61.So therefore this investor is indifferent between taking$11,715.61 and playing this lottery.Let's conclude and summarize what we've learned so far.We're given three investors.Investor A is risk neutral because shehas a linear utility function.Both investors B and C are risk averse,because they have concave utility function.Investor C is more risk averse than investor B.So therefore if all three investorsare presented with the same lottery,we would expect that certainty equivalent of investor Awould be higher than that of investor Bwhich in turn will be higher than that of investor C.And this is exactly what we found.Investor A is willing to trade the lotteryfor a guaranteed payoff or certaintyequivalent of $17,000.Investor B is he's willing to trade offthis exact same lottery for $12,800.So the difference between certainty equivalenceof investor A and investor B shows youhow much more risk averse investor Bis compared to investor A.And certainly equivalent of investor Bis greater than certainty equivalent of investor Cwhich is $11,716, which again is due to the factthat investor C is more risk averse than investor Band is willing to trade this lottery for a lower guaranteedamount.

#### 415-1x_Rec 06_Q2, Part D-en

PROFESSOR: Let's consider another lottery.This lottery is similar to the original one in the sensethat it has the same expected payoff.And you can verify that.But it is more risky.So the standard deviation of the payoff of this lotteryis higher.You could see that the first one, the first payoff, Iincrease it from $80,000 to $89,000,and I've decreased the bottom one from $5,000 to $3,500.So this would make this lottery more risky.What I want to understand here ishow the certainty equivalence changed for investor A, the onewith the linear utility function, and for investor C.This was the one who is the most risk averse here.Let's start with investor A. So firstwe compute the expected utility that this investor getsfrom this lottery.So this would be $17,000.This is by construction.I constructed this lottery to be as such.Now, if we want to find certainty equivalentfor this investor, recall that this investorhas linear utility functions.So the certainty equivalent of this investor is just $17,000.So therefore this investor is indifferent between taking$17,000 and this lottery.And therefore, these investor has exactly the same certaintyequivalent as with the previous lottery,although these lottery is riskier.This happens because this investor is risk neutral.She doesn't care about the fact that these lottery is riskier.And this is illustrated by the factthat certainty equivalent for this investor is the same.Now let's consider the next investor,the one who is risk averse.The expected utility from this lottery for this investoris given by this equation.If we compute this, this would give us 21.72.Now, if you find the certainty equivalent--so certainty equivalent is going to beequal to 21.72 raised to the power 3,and so this would be equal to $10,243.43.So for this investor, the certainty equivalent decreases.And this is expected, because this investor is risk averse.In this case, she's presented with a lottery thathas exactly the same expected payoff,but it is a risky lottery.And because this investor is risk averse,it stands to reason that the certainty equivalent,or the guaranteed amount that this investor willbe willing to trade for this lottery, decreases.And this is what we see by doing these calculations.

#### 415-1x_Rec 06_Q3, Part A-en

PROFESSOR: In this question, we willlearn how to find the risk premium for an investorfor whom we know their utility functionand for a given investment opportunityor for a given lottery.We will consider the following two investors, A and B,with the following utility functions.You can verify that these utility functions are concaveand both of these investors are risk averse.There is an investment opportunity.That's with probability 0.5 with 25% return, positive 25%,and with the remaining probabilityof 0.5 returns, negative 25%.We will start by assuming that both of these investors haveinitial wealth of $1.00.And first, we'll compute their coefficients of relative riskaversion, evaluate it at the initial wealth.Two, for both of these investors,we'll compute the risk premium associatedwith the above investment opportunity.Let's start by computing the coefficient of relative riskaversion for both of these investors.By definition, relative risk aversionof a given investor with wealth Wis given by the following expression.So it's negative wealth multipliedby the second derivative of the utility function.Evaluate it at W. Divide it by the first derivativeof the utility function.Evaluate it, W.Let's start with the first the investor.Her utility function is this.It's X raised to the power 1 over 3.And what we need to do, we need to computethe first and the second derivative of this utilityfunction.So that we can compute the coefficient,the relative risk aversion.So the first derivative of this utility functionis given by the first part of this expression,and then the second derivative we can computeis given by the second part.Plugging both of these expressionsinto the definition of relative risk aversiongives us the following, which, if we compute,just gives us 2/3.Therefore, the coefficient of relative risk aversionof investor A is just 2/3.Now, let's do the same for investor B.This is investors B utility function,so the first step is, again, to computethe first and second derivative of the utility function.And these are the expressions for the firstand the second derivative.Plugging both of these into the definitiongives us the following expression.If we compute this, we would get 1/3 multiplied by W.And since the question asks us to evaluate the coefficient,the relative risk aversion for both of these investorsat the points of the initial wealth,we need to plug-in W into this equation for investor B.So given that her wealth is $1.00,this gives us the coefficient of relative risk aversion for thisinvestor of just 1/3.So to summarize so far, investor Ahas a higher relative risk aversion coefficient,and it equals to 2/3.And investor B has a lower relative risk aversioncoefficient, and it equals to 1/3.Both of which are evaluated at the initial wealth of $1.00.

Let's find a risk premium for these investors.By definition, the risk premium pi is the fraction of wealththat an investor is willing to losethat makes her indifferent between a risky zeroexpected return investment x and the sure loss pi.Mathematically, we can write it as follows.Recall that the investment opportunity that we havein this question is as follows.So it said the positive 25% or negative 25%would equal probabilities 1/2.So notice that this investment opportunity's zeroexpected return investment.Let's first compute the expected utilityfrom investing into this project investment opportunity.So by definition it's 1/2 times utility in the upstate.So this is $1 multiplied by positive 25% returnplus another 1/2 multiplied by the utility of $1and multiplied by 1 minus 25%.So this is our loss state.Given that the first investor has cube root utility function,for her this expected utility becomes as such.1/2 multiplied by 1.25 raised to the power of 1 over 3plus 1/2 multiplied by 0.75 raised the same powerof 1 over 3.And so this gives us 0.993.Now knowing this expected utility,we can compute the risk premium for this investorfrom this equation.So again, the utility function is cube root and the wealthof this investor W is $1.So this gives us this equation.0.993 equals to 1 minus pi raisedto the power of 1 over 3.All we need to do is to solve this equation for pi.And this gives us 2.12%.So therefore the risk premium required by this investorfor this investment opportunity is 2.12%.In other words, this investor is indifferent between losingfor sure 2.12% of her initial wealth of $1and engaging in this 0% expected return investmentopportunity that has a certain level of risk.Now let's compute risk premium for investorB. We started with the same exact equation.The only difference right now is, of course,the utility function.So for this investor, the expected utilityfrom this investment opportunity is 1/2 multiplied by 1 minus eraised to the power negative 1.25 dividedby 3 plus 1/2 multiplied by 1 minus eraised to the power of negative 0.75 divided by 3.So this equals to 0.281.Now again, knowing this expected utility,we can find the risk premium for this investor.Again, we know the utility function and the initial wealthis $1.So therefore this gives us the following expression.All we need to do is to solve this expression for pi.Doing this gives us 1.04%.So therefore, this is the risk premiumrequired by this investor for this given lottery.So in other words, this investor iswilling to lose for sure 1.04% of the initial wealth$1, indifferent between that and engagingin this 0% expected return risky investment opportunity.Let's summarize.When both investors A and B have initial wealth of $1,investor A has a higher coefficientof relative risk aversion compared to investor B.Risk premium required by investor Ato invest into this lottery is also highercompared to that of investor B.So therefore, both relative risk aversion coefficientand the risk premium line up in such a waythat if the coefficient of the relative risk aversion for oneinvestor is higher than that for another one,the risk premium required for investing into this giveninvestment opportunity would also be higherfor the investor, would be higher coefficientof relative risk aversion.

PROFESSOR: Let's now assume that both of these investorsgot richer.Their wealth was $1.Right now their wealth is $5.We will repeat the same calculations.So we'll compute the coefficients of relative riskaversion for both of these investors giventheir new wealth.And we will compute the risk premium associatedwith this risky investment opportunitythat we are considering in this question.Recall that the relative risk aversion that we can computedfor investor A was just 2/3.Notice something very important.This coefficient, the relative risk aversion for this investordoes not depend on her wealth.It's 2/3 regardless of how rich this investor is.This is what we call constant relative risk aversion.The risk aversion of this investordoes not depend on how wealthy she is.For Investor B, however, the relative risk aversiondoes depend on the wealth of this investor.Recall that the relative risk aversion of this investorwas 1 over 3 multiplied by wealth w.So when wealth is $5, the relative risk aversionof this investor is 5/3.So generally for this investor, risk aversionincreases as this investor gets richer.Now let's compute the risk premium for investorA. First we're computing the expected utility this investorgets from this lottery.It's the same expression as we had before,but right now instead of $1, we have $5.This is our current wealth.Computing this gives us the expected utility of 1.698.And now we can compute the risk premiumby solving the following equation.So recall that the utility function of this investoris cube root.And the wealth right now is $5.Solving this equation for pi gives us 2.12%,this is exactly the same 2.12% as we had before.So now, given the higher wealth of these investors, so $5,this investor has still required risk premium of 2.12%.And in fact, this risk premium would notdepend on the level of wealth of this investor.Just because the risk aversion of these investorsdoes not depend on her wealth.Now for Investor B, we have the same expression.Using the utility function of this investor,we can compute that the expected utility from this lotteryis 0.794.To compute the risk premium, we're solving this equation.We know the utility function.We know w, which is $5.Plugging this in gives us this equation,which we need to solve for pi.Solving this equation for pi gives us 5.06%.And so given the wealth of $5, this investor right nowhas a risk premium of 5.06%.Let's summarize.Investor A has a constant relative risk aversion.Regardless of whether her wealth is $1 of $5,the coefficient of relative risk aversion of this investoris just 2/3.Regardless of how rich this investor is,the risk premium associated with this particular investmentopportunity is 2.12%.For any other level of wealth, it will always stay constantat the same exact level.Risk premium, of course, would differif we give this investor a different investmentopportunity.That investment opportunity may have a different risk premium.But for this particular investment,for any level of wealth, risk premium stays constant.But investor B, the richer this investor becomes,the more risk averse she gets, isindicated by increasing relative risk aversion coefficient.When her wealth is $5, the coefficientof relative risk aversion is 5/3,which is higher than that of investor Aat that level of risk.And so therefore when you comparerisk premium for investor A and B,when they both have wealth of $5,the risk premium required by investor Bis higher than that of investor A.Finally, as Investor B becomes richer,her relative risk aversion increases and so doesthe risk premium she requires from investinginto this lottery.You could compare the first case when she's--when her wealth is $1 and her risk premiumis 1.04% to the case when her wealth is $5 and the riskpremium is 5.06%.This risk premium will continue risingas this investor gets richer.

PROFESSOR: In this question, we will learn what is a portfolioand how to compute portfolio weights.Suppose that you're a financial advisorand you have the following two clients,client P with a portfolio P, and client Q with a portfolio Q.Client P has the following securities in her portfolio,she invests $25,000 in SPY, whichis ETF that tracks S&P 500 Index, 35,000 into this ETF,this is ETF, Vanguard's ETF, thattracks returns on short term Treasury securities,and $50,000 into this ETF, this isiShares ETF that tracks return of emerging markets.Now client Q has the following portfolio, so $10,000invested in SPY, so same ETF, $10,000 investedin this short term Treasury ETF, 30,000is invested in this emerging markets ETF,and 20,000 invested into this additional ETF thattracks returns on mortgage backed securities.So notice that client P does not haveMBB or this ETF in her portfolio but client Q does.So the first question that we'll answer hereis that we'll compute portfolio weights that clients Pand Q have on each individual securities in their portfolios.Let's start with client P. So first to computethe weights of each of these individual ETFsin her portfolio, first step is to compute the total valueof her portfolio.So this is just weighting up the total assetvalue of each individual ETF, this gives us $75,000.Then to compute the weight that SPY has in her portfoliowe're taking the value of SPY in her portfolio, so $25,000,and dividing it by the total value of the portfolio, whichis $75,000.This gives us one third or 0.33.We're doing exactly the same for the second ETF,for the short term Treasury ETF, so the $35,000,this is assets on that or the valueof this ETF in this portfolio, divided by the total value$75,000, this gives us 0.47.And finally, for the emerging markets ETF,15,000 divided by 75,000 gives us 0.2.Now these are the weights.So this is the answer to this question.So the weight of SPY is 0.33, the weightof short term ETF in this portfolio is 0.47,and the weight of IEMG is 0.2.Now let's verify, so this is going to be trivialbut let's still verify that the weights in this portfolioadd up to 1.Remember that this is a definition of the portfolio.So a portfolio is a collection of securities suchthat the weights of each individual securityin the portfolio should add up to 1.If they don't, then this is not a portfolio by definition.So here, just to verify, so 0.33, plus 0.47, plus 0.2,this gives us exactly, exactly 1.Again, in this particular case, this is trivial,but this just re-emphasizes the definitionof what portfolio actually is.Let's repeat the same process for client Qor for portfolio Q. So the total value of this portfoliois the sum of the value of individual ETFs,so this is $70,000.To compute the weight of SPY we aretaking the value of SPY, 10,000, dividing it by 70,000.That's the total value of the portfolio,so that gives us 0.14.We're doing the same for short term Treasury ETF,so 10,000 divided by 70,000 also 0.14.The weights of the emerging market ETFis 30,000, its value divided by 70,000, that's 0.43.And finally, the weight of the mortgagebacked securities ETF, 20,000 divided by 70,000, that's 0.29.So these are the weights of each of these fourassets in the portfolio of this client Q.Again, just to check to make sure that all of the weightsadd up to 1, we can add them all up.And just to verify that they all add up to 1and this indeed is the portfolio sothat we haven't made a mistake computing any of the weightshere.

#### 415-1x_Rec 06_Q5, Part B-en

PROFESSOR: Now let's assume that Portfolios P and Q getcombined.They get combined into a new portfolio.And we'll call this portfolio R.So for example, imagine that P and Q are trustsand they just combined and merged.And they combined their assets.And so all of these assets get combined into portfolio R.And now the question is, what arethe new weights of these individual assetsin this new portfolio, in the merged portfolio,R. To find the weights of individual assetsin this new Portfolio R, first, let'sfind the total value of Portfolio R.So we're simply adding up the valueof each of these individual assetsor because we knew the value of Portfolio Pand the value of Portfolio Q so $75,000 and $70,000respectively.So the total value of this combined portfolio rightnow is $75,000 plus $70,000.That's $145,000.So that's the total value of Portfolio R.To find the weights, we're simplyadding up the weights of individual positionsin Portfolios P and Q and dividing itby the total value of the new portfolio.So $25,000 for SPY in Portfolio Pplus $10,000 for SPY in Portfolio Q.So that's $35,000 divided by $145,000.And that's 0.24.Same exact process for the remaining three assets.So for the short term treasury ETF $35,000here plus $10,000 here divided by $145,000.That's 0.31.For emerging markets ETF, $15,000 here, $30,000 here,divided by $145,000, also 0.31.And for the mortgage backed securities ETF, $0 here,$20,000 here divided by $145,000.That gives us 0.14.And so these are the weights of eachof the four individual securitiesin this new portfolio, combined portfolio, are.Again, just to make sure that we haven't done arithmeticmistakes somewhere, to make sure that that didn't happen,we add up the weights of individual assetsand just make sure that it all adds up to 1.And in this case, it indeed all adds up to 1.So this portfolio looks OK.So all of the weights add up to 1.And this is how you compute portfolio weights giventhe position and individual assets in a portfolio.

PROFESSOR: Suppose that you have $20,000 that youwould like to invest.You're very bullish on the future of clean energy,and you found the following exchange traded fund, or ETF,that you would like to invest--iShares clean energy ETF, the ticker symbol ICLN.But you are so bullish on the clean energythat not only do you want to investall your wealth into this ETF, youwould want to borrow and invest borrowed money into this ETFas well.Your broker allows you to borrow up to $45,000,giving you wealth of $20,000.So what do you will do is that youwill borrow the full amount of $45,000,and you will invest all of it into this ETF.The first question asks us, what isthe weight on this ETF on ICLN in your portfolio?By definition, the weight in your portfolio on ICLN would beyour position in this ETF, which is $20,000--this is your initial wealth--plus your borrowed funds divided by your total wealth,or often referred to as the equity of your portfolio.So your position divided by your wealth, by $20,000.So this gives us 325%.So the weight on this ETF in your portfolio is 325%.We can also compute the weights that you have on the loan,or the borrowed funds in your portfolio.So you borrowed $45,000, hence a negative sign,divided by your wealth.So this gives us negative 225%.Now, this indeed is a portfolio, because if we add upyour weight in this borrowed fundsplus your weight in this ETF, this gives us 100%.And so recall that by definition,weights in the portfolio have to add up to 100%.

#### 415-1x_Rec 06_Q6, Part B-en

PROFESSOR: The second question asksus, what is the leverage ratio of your portfolio?Let's start again with the definition of leverage ratio.So leverage ratio is the total asset valuethat we have in our portfolio divided by net investments.So the total asset value is $65,000.This is how much we have invested in this ETF,and our net investment is $20,000.So this net investment is your own wealth,or, also, we refer to it as equity of your portfolio.So this ratio gives us 3.25%.So the leverage ratio of this portfolio that weconstructed here is 3.25.

#### 415-1x_Rec 06_Q6, Part C-en

PROFESSOR: Now suppose that you were right,and the value of this EFT--so the value of clean energy EFT--increases by 25%.The question is, what is the return on your investment?Let's answer this question.First, I will compute the total asset value of your portfolio.So recall that we have $65,000 invested into this ETF.So this asset value right now increased by 25%.So the new value is $81,250.Now, of this, $45,000 is borrowed.So therefore, the new value of your net investmentis the new asset value minus this borrowed amount.This gives us $36,250.So therefore, you have invested $20,000.And right now, your net investment is $36,250.So now we can compute the return.So the return is the new value of your net investmentminus the original value divided by the original value.And so this gives us 81.25 percent return.So therefore, if the energy ETF increased in value by 25%,the value or the return on your investment is 81.25 percent.Now let me show you an alternative wayof doing the same calculation.Recall that the leveraged investmentreturn equals to the leverage ratio times the asset return.So this is the overall change in the value of your portfolio.And so in this case, our leverage ratiothat we computed before was 3.25.And now, we are multiplying by how much the assetvalue or our ETF has changed.This is 25%.And so this gives us 81.25 percent return.And this exactly matches the numberthat we've computed up here.So this is one of the major benefitsof knowing the leverage ratio of your portfoliobecause it allows you to quickly understand, and approximate,and measure by how much the valueof your original investment has changedas a function of how much the total value of assetschanges in your portfolio.So in this case, the value of assets increased by 25%.And because we have a leveraged positionand this is our leverage, we have the net investment gainof 81.25 percent.

#### 415-1x_Rec 06_Q6, Part E-en

PROFESSOR: So let's summarize this question.If we just invested our initial wealth into this clean energyETF, the returns on our investmentwould have been either negative 25%if the value declined by 25% or positive 25%if the value increased by 25%.So this is the situation where we had no leverage.With leverage, if we borrowed $45,000and invested the entire $65,000 into this ETF,then if the value of ETF either increased by 25%or decreased by 25%, our net investment returnswould have been either negative 85.25% or positive 81.25%.So this leverage magnifies both gains and lossesfor our initial investment.And that's the idea behind leverage.

#### 415-1x_Rec 06_Q7, Part A-en

PROFESSOR: In this question, we aregiven two stocks, stock A and stock B,with the following properties.Stock A has expected return of 20%.Stock B has expected return of 15%.Standard deviations are 20% and 25%, respectively.The correlation between the returns on stock A and stock Bis 0.2, or 20%.The first question asks us whether any investor would everinvest in stock B. And this is a reasonable questionto ask because if you look at the properties of stock Band compare them to stock A, stock B looks, indeed,on its own, inferior to stock A. So it has lowerexpected return, and it has a higher standard deviation.So hence, the question, would ever any of the investor herewould ever invest into stock B?And the answer is yes.Because of its low correlation with stock A,this stock, although on its own inferior,may provide diversification benefits.And hence, a rational investor maywant to invest a fraction of his or her own wealth into stock Bto get these diversification benefits.

#### 415-1x_Rec 06_Q7, Part B-en

PROFESSOR: In the next question, weare asked to form the following portfolio.So we will mix or we'll invest 60% of our wealthinto stock A and 40% into stock B.So we're going to form this portfolio which I will refer toas P, which again invest 60% in a 40% in b.The question asks us to find the expected returnon this portfolio, P.Let's do the definition of expected returnfor a portfolio.Expected return on a portfolio would equal to the weightthat we'd invest in the first stock times the expected returnon this stock, plus weight that we'dinvest in the second stock times the expected returnon the second stock.Now, if we've had more --you could see that this is just a simple linear function --so if we had more stocks in our portfolio,we could just continue writing the following linearexpression.So now since we have only two stockswe can plug in the weights and the corresponding expectedreturns.So weights in a 60% expected return 20.40% in b and it's expected return is 15%.So if we compute this, this will give us 18%.So the expected return on this portfolio P is 18%.

#### 415-1x_Rec 06_Q7, Part C-en

PROFESSOR: The next question asksus to find the standard deviation of this portfolio P.So recall that this portfolio P put 60% into A and 40% into B.So let's write down the expression for the varianceof a portfolio of two stocks.So the variance of this portfolio, RPequals to the weight that we put in the first stock,stock A, squared, times the varianceof the returns of stock A, plus weightsthat we put into stock B squared times the variance of stock Bplus 2 times weights that we put into A and Btimes the covariance of the returns between stocks A and B.In this question, we're given the correlation of returnsbetween A and B. So what I will dois, I will expand this equation, where I will express covarianceof the function of standard deviations of returns of stocksA and B and their correlation.So the first two terms remain the same.The third term becomes 2 times the weightstimes the standard deviation of the returns on A timesthe standard deviation of the returns on B,times the correlation of the returns between the two stocks.So this is just the definition of the covariance.Now we're ready to plug in all the numbers.So the weights are 60% and 40%, so it's0.6 squared, 0.4 squared, multipliedby the variance of the returns of stock A, whichis standard deviation 0.2, 20%.Then it means that the variance is 20%, or 0.2 squared.0.25 for stock B, so 0.25 squared--this is the variance of stock B.And this third term is the covarianceof the correlation term.So it's 2 times the weights times two standard deviations,so 0.2 and 0.25, times the correlationof the returns between stocks A and B. So this is 0.2.So when you compute this, we get 0.0292.And so this is the variance of the portfolioP. Since the question asks us to find the standard deviation--so what we do is that we're takingthe square root of this variance, and we get 17.1%.So this is the standard deviationof the returns of the portfolio P, which invests 60% into stockA and 40% into stock B.

#### 415-1x_Rec 06_Q7, Part D-en

PROFESSOR: Now suppose that the correlationbetween returns on Stock A and Stock Bincreases from 0.2 to 0.6.We're going to keep the same Portfolio P that invests 60into A and 40 into B. And we willtry to compute the expected return on this portfolioand the standard deviation.So first, let's answer the following question.Does the fact that correlation changed from 0.2 to 0.6affect the returns on this portfolio?The answer is that it doesn't.The expected return on the portfolioonly depends on the weights that weput in the corresponding stocks and on the expectedreturns on the stocks.It does not depend on how returns on different assetscould vary within that portfolio.So therefore, expected return in this casestays the same as it was before.In particular, it is 18%.Now standard deviation, on the other hand,for the Portfolio P, is affected because if welook at the formula for the variance of Portfolio P,we see that it obviously depends on the correlation of returnsbetween A and B. And so now, to compute the standard deviation,what I will do is that everything else stays the same.So the only term that changes in this equationis the correlation term.So instead of point 0.2, what it was before,it is 0.6 right now.And so I highlighted it in pink color.And so if it computes the variance of this portfolioperiod now, given this new correlation,it gives me 0.0388.And so to compute the standard deviation,I again have to take the square root of this term.And so this gives me 19.7%.So when correlation goes up to 0.6,expect the return stays the same at 18%.But the standard deviation of the portfolioincreases from 17.1% to 19.7%

#### 415-1x_Rec 06_Q7, Part E-en

PROFESSOR: In this next question,we are asked to construct a portfoliowith expected return of 19.5%.I will call this Portfolio Q. So wewant to construct a portfolio suchthat expected return is 19.5%.So let's again start with just the expressionfor the expected return of the portfolio.So expected return of the portfolioQ equals to the weight that we put into A timesthe expected return of stock A plus the weight that weput into B times expected return on stock B.Now notice that by definition of a portfolio, weightA plus weight B has to add up to 1.So here I will write an expression of for a weight Bas the function of weight A. And I will plug thisinto the above equation.So this is going to give me expected return for Portfolio Qas the function of weight we put into weight times expectedreturn on stock A plus 1 minus weight that we put into A timesexpected return of stock B. And now wewant to make this expression equal to 19.5%.So now I'm going to plug in expected returns for stocks Aand B from what's given, so 20% and 15%.And this becomes just an equation with one unknown.So we can solve it for wA.And this gives us 90%.So therefore to construct a portfolio that gives usexpected return of 19.5%, we put 90% of our assetsinto stock A and the remaining 10%,because again, weights have to add up to 1and we have only two stocks so the remaining10% we put into stock B. So Portfolio Qwould be 90A and 10B.

#### 415-1x_Rec 06_Q7, Part F-en

PROFESSOR: Now, what is the standard deviationof this portfolio Q that puts 90% into A and 10% into B?Let's use, again-- this is the formula for the variance first,and then we'll compute standard deviationbased on the variance, as we computed for this portfolio Q.So again, it's weight squared times the variance of A plus B,weight that we put into B squared, timesthe variance of the returns of stock B,plus 2 times weights times standard deviationof A, standard deviation of B, times the correlation.So notice that I go back to correlation,the original correlation coefficientthat we had between the two stocks, which is 0.2.So I plug in all of the numbers, so 0.9 squared--this is our weight, 90%, that we put in this portfolio Q,into stock A, so 90% squared, times 20%squared, plus 0.1 squared plus 0.25 squared plus 2 timesthe two weights, so 0.9 and 0.1, times the standard deviation,so 0.2, 0.25, times the correlation, so 0.2.So this gives me 0.035.And this is the variance of our portfolio Q. Takingsquare root of that gives me the standard deviationof this portfolio Q, which is 18.8%.So what we have done in this question is,we were able to construct a portfolio with a given expectedreturn that we want, which is 19.5%,by putting 90% into stock A and 10% of our wealth into stock B.And this particular portfolio Q hasa standard deviation of 18.8%.

#### 415-1x_Rec 06_Q8-en

PROFESSOR: In this question, we willlook at diversification benefits of holdinga portfolio with many stocks.Let's assume that the average stock has a volatility of 35%.So that's a standard deviation.Let's also assume that the average correlationbetween pairs of stocks is 25%.And let's compute the following.Let's compute the volatility of equally weighted portfolio thathas just one stock, 20 stocks, and 500 stocks.Let's first derive the variance of Portfolio P, equallyweighted portfolio.So this is the sum of all possible combinationsof covariance between stock i and j with the weightsthat we put into stock i and j.So if we think of this variance-covariance metricswhere we have on the diagonal, the varianceof individual stocks and off diagonal elementsof the pair-wise covariances, then thisis just simply the weighted averageof all of these items in this matrix.Again with the weights that we put in each of these individualstocks, these w's.Since we have an equally weighted portfoliothis w's are, each of them, just 1 over n.And so this product is just 1 over n squared.So this variance becomes the sum of 1over n squared multiplied by the pair-wise covariancebetween stock i and stock j.Now I'm going to break down this sum into the following twosums.One is the sum of this variance.So visually if you think of this term, whatI'll try to do visually here is that Iwill separate the variance, what I have hereon the main diagonal, from the covariances.So I'm taking the variance.And there are n of them.And so 1 over n squared times allof the sum of these variances plus 1 over n squared,the remaining sum of all possible covariances here.So notice that in this covariance term,I'm saying that this is the first summation from i to nand then the second summation from j to n.But I'm saying that j should not equal to i because theseare the ones that this would be the variance terms that Iseparated into this first sum.So now what I'm going to do furtheris that I will factor out 1 over n first.And then what is going to be remaininghere is 1 over n times the sum of the variances hereof all stocks from 1 to n.And so this term right here in parenthesesis just the average variance.We can think of it this way.And we know because this equationgives us what is the average volatility of stockso we would know what is the average variance.So similarly, here I will try to isolate the average covariancein the second term.So the average covariance is justthe sum of all of the covariance dividedby the number of the covariance terms that we have.What is the number of this covariance terms here?Well, again, so referring back to these matrix,you can think of it as just the number of off diagonal elementshere.And so if the total number of elements in this matrixis just n squared, the number of diagonal elementsis n squared minus n.And so therefore I'm isolating here 1divided by n squared minus n.So this is the number, again, of the covariance terms multipliedby the sum of all of these covariance terms.And that's what's remaining.So it's n squared that we had before.And I'm now multiplying here by n squared minus nto offset this additional divisionthat I put here so that this representsthe average covariance.Now so what we have is that the variance of this portfolio,equally weighted portfolio, equals to one over n multipliedby the average variance, plus this term which isyou can see that n squared is going to cancel out.So it's 1 minus 1 over n.So there's this term.And then what I have in parentheses hereis just the average covariance.And so therefore we have 1 over n times average varianceplus 1 minus 1 over n times the average covariance.And again, we know both the average volatility herethere is a variance and the average correlation.So we can compute the average covariance between the pairsof stocks here.Now once we know this expression,now we can plug in n equals to 1, n equals to 20,and n equals to 500, and to compute the varianceof these portfolios.So let's work with this expressionto compute the volatility of equally weighted portfoliosof 1, 20 and 500 stocks.So first let me compute the average variance and averagecovariance from the information that we're given here.So the average variance would be justthe average standard deviation that we're given, 35% squared.And the average covariance would be the average correlationwhich were given again, 25%, multipliedby two standard deviations of the average standard deviationsof stock.So 0.35 times 0.35.And now so we know the average varianceand we know the average covariance, so we can compute--we just simply can plug in n's for 1, 20 and 500and compute the variances and standard deviationsof this respective portfolios.When n equals to 1, this is the variance.And the standard deviation of this portfolio would be 35%.And it does make sense.So if you look back at this equation, so if n equals to 1,this term equals to 0 so this is not relevant.And so this equals to 1.And so this is just the average variance.And so therefore, if we have just Portfolio 1 stock,its standard deviation is going to beequal to the average standard deviation of stock here, 35%.When we have 20 stocks, this is the variancethat we can compute by plugging 20 in here.And the standard deviation of this portfolio would be 18.77%.When we have 500 stocks, the standard deviationof this portfolio would be 17.55%.So these are the volatilities of these three portfolios.Now let's look at these numbers.By combining as few as 20 stocks into a portfolio, equallyweighted portfolio, we were able to reduce the volatility almosttwice from 35% to 18.77%.So this is a dramatic reduction in volatility,and we get it by just combining as few as 20 stocksin our portfolio.Once we keep adding more stocks, we stillget the reciprocation benefits.But they're not seemingly as largeas they're here in the very beginningwhere we're combining just few stocks.You can look at this from when we get from 20 to 500.The reduction in volatility is just from 18.77% to 17.85%.So this is again-- so there is a reduction here but seeminglynot as large as it is here originally.And so therefore, the main lesson hereis that we get a lot of diversification benefitsby combining just a few stocks in our portfolio giventhat the average correlation between returnsis not that large.And so in this particular case, if it's 25%,most of this reduction is driven by the factthat we're combining a few stocksand the average correlation between these stocksis just 25%.And so, again, as we keep adding,we don't get as much as we get initiallywhen we adding a few stocks.Let's see what happens when we'recombining more and more stocks in our portfolio,in other words, when n goes to infinity.When n goes to infinity, the variance of this portfoliois going to become equal to average covariance.We could see it from this expression.1 over n is going to go to 0 when n goes to infinity.1 minus 1 over n is going to go to 1.And so therefore, this expressionis just going to become average covariance.And therefore the standard deviationof the portfolio that has infinitely many stockswould be the square root of the average covariance, whichwould be 17.5%.so as we're combining infinitely many stocks,the absolute minimum that volatility of our portfoliothat we can achieve in this particular economy is 17.5%.

#### Q4-en

PROFESSOR: In this question, we willwork with historical returns and wewill learn how to compute major statistics--means, standard deviations, and correlations.We will work with the following three exchange-traded funds--Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF, iShares 20+ Year Treasury BondETF, and Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets ETF.Our sample will consist of monthly returnsand will cover the last decade, January 2010through December 2019.Before we go ahead and compute statistics,let me first tell you a few interesting factsabout these exchange-traded funds.This is an example of a fact sheet for Vanguard Total StockMarket ETF.It shows few interesting statistics.First, it shows the number of stocks currently tradedon the US exchanges.This number is 3,535 stocks.An interesting fact is that the number of publicly traded firmsin the United States has been declining over the past decade.Second, we can see sector breakdown of the US economy.Technology comprises a quarter of all public traded stocksin the US, financials in the second place,health care in the third.And finally, here we can see the largest stocksin the United States.As of March 31, 2020, Microsoft was first, Apple second.Amazon, Alphabet, and Facebook are the third, fourth,and fifth.Second ETF is a 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF.This ETF invests in long Treasury bonds.You could see that all of the top holdingsconsist of Treasury bond.These are the bonds that, at the time of issuance,have 30 years until maturity.If you look at the current portfolio of holdingsas of July 9, 2020, these are the different maturitieson these long bonds that comprisethe portfolio of this ETF.And indeed, you can see that all of themhave more than 20 years to maturity.Finally, the last ETF is the Emerging Markets ETF.Here, some of the interesting statisticscome from composition of countries in this ETF.So you could see that China has almost 50%of the entire holdings of this ETF,followed by Taiwan, India, Brazil, South Africa, Russia,and so forth.You could see that sectoral breakdown in emerging marketsis a little different compared to the United States.The first sector that has more than a quarter of all holdingsis financials, followed by technology, consumer services,industrials, and consumer goods.Now that you have some color on these ETFs,let's start working with data and compute basic statistics.This is the data file that gives us monthly returns.So it starts from January 2010 and goes all the wayto December 2019.The numbers in this file are percentage returns.For example, in January 2010, VTI had a negative 3.5% return.And so all of these numbers that are given hereare just percentages.Let's start with sample mean.Here I provide formulas so that we can easilysee what is it that we're trying to compute.I will try to use directly the formulas and compute by handthese statistics.And then I will show you shortcuts and someof the formulas in Excel that allowto compute some of these basic statistics, but more easily.So let's start with the sample mean.Sample mean, by definition, is justthe sum of all returns divided by the number of these returns.So I'll first compute it by hand.So I will say sample mean here.And I will first add up all of the returns, for example,for VTI.So this is the sum of all returns.And then I will divide it by the number of observationsthat we have here.So the number of observations we have is we have 10 years.And monthly return-- so it's 120.So if we divide this by 120, thiswould be the mean return that we had on VTI during the sampleperiod.Now, another way to compute sample meanis just to use average function in Excel.So if we do this, we get exactly the same answer.So we could see that the return is exactly the same.So from now on, I will just use the average functionto compute the returns.So I'll say average here.And I will extend this to the other two ETFs.So here we can see the following.The average monthly return on the US entire stockmarket on this ETF is 1.12% per month during this time period.The long bond, the TLT ETF--the average return was 0.65%, which is perhaps higherthan you would have thought because this is a fixed incomeinstrument issued by the government.And finally, emerging markets produced 0.4% monthly return,which is, during this sample period,significantly below the monthly return that was producedby the US stock market.Next, let's compute sample variance.I will create some workspace for me here.And the first thing that I would like to dois I would like to use directly the formulato compute the sample variance.So I will take the differences between monthly returnsand the estimated sample mean.I will square them.I will add them up.And then I will divide it by T minus 1.So I will do it here.So I'll take the difference between a returnin the given month minus the estimated sample mean.And I will square this difference.Now I will add up and sum up all of these square differences.And then I will divide this number by T minus 1.So T, in our case, is 120--minus 1 is 119.We are, by the way, dividing it by T minus 1 because we are--already used this data to estimate sample means.So we are losing one degree of freedomwhen we estimating the second moment, or the variance here.And so this number right now-- so 13.873--this is sample variance.For us to get sample standard deviation,I'm just taking the square root of this variance.And this is the number right now.Now, there's, of course, much easier way in Excelto do the same calculation.So all I have to do is that I can use STDEV.S function.So this is the function that computes sample standarddeviation.So if I do this and I just simply takethe-- all the array of returns and I hit Enter,I get exactly the same number.So the standard deviation of returns on VTI is 3.725%.And so now I will just delete this here.I showed you how to compute this.Now we can just directly use this functionfor the rest of the ETFs.So we'll say this is sample standard deviation.And since we computed this for VTI,we can extend this and to compute itfor the other two ETFs.So very interestingly, you could see that the sample standarddeviation for the long bond ETF isalmost the same as for the stock market in the United States.So the returns on long bond are quite volatile.And again, you can also see that the standard deviationon the returns on the emerging marketis actually quite a bit higher than the standard deviationof returns in the United States.Now, finally, let's compute covariance.I'll first compute, again, covariance by handand then correlation by using the formulas here.And I will do it for VTI and TLT.So first, I will compute the differencesbetween monthly returns and estimated means on the twoETFs.I will multiply them.And then I will add them up.So I will create just a little bit more,again, workspace for me here.So the first thing I will compute is this differencesand then multiply them.So this is monthly return minus the estimated mean multipliedby the same for the second ETF.So this is computing the same product for every month.Now I will add up this sums.So I will sum them all up.And then I'll also divide it by T minus 1.So-- or by 119 in our case.And so now this number here is the covariance, or the samplecovariance, between the total stock market in the USand the returns on the long bond ETF.You can see that this number is negative,which means that there is a negative covarianceand, hence, will be negative correlationbetween the returns on these two financial instruments.Now that we know the covariance, let us compute correlation.So correlation will be just the covariance,which we'll have to divide by the two standard deviationswhich we already computed.So we will take this number.And we will divide it by the standard deviationof the first ETF and by the second--by the standard deviation of the second ETF.And now-- so this is the correlation.So you could see that correlationis almost negative 50%.Now, of course, there has to be another wayof computing this correlation.And we can simply just use the CORREL function in Excel,which does this job for us.So if we do this first array here--so it requires two inputs--so the first array and the second array.So this is the first one.And now this is the second.When we hit Enter, we're going to get exactly the same number.The point of this exercise is to show youthat we can compute all of the statisticsby hand because we understand what the statistics are.But then we can use building functionsto compute this correlations more automatically.So this is the correlation between VTIand TLT. I will delete this column for now because wedon't need it anymore.And I'll just use this function to compute this correlations.So this is the correlation between VTI and TLT.The other correlation here-- we'll compute the correlationbetween TLT and the emerging market ETF--so this one.And this is the second array.So this would be the correlation between TLT and VWO.And the third correlation here will bethe correlation between VTI--so between the US stock market--and the emerging stock market.So CORREL-- and then I'm putting the first arrayin and then the second array.And this is the result.So it paints us a very interesting picture.So first is that there is very negativeand strong correlation, at least historical correlation,between the returns on the total stock market in the USand on the long bond.Second, there is also low correlation, although a littleless, between the returns on the bond ETF and the emergingmarkets.And the third fact, and perhaps very interestingfact because you would have thoughtthat maybe the returns on the US stock market and emergingmarkets are not very well correlated, what this numbershows here is that the correlation between the twois almost 75%, which is a very significant correlation--means that the US stock market, at least historically again,and emerging markets correlated very highly with one another.If you are a US investor and you're looking to diversifyyour current portfolio-- let's imagine that you are 100%invested in the US stock market and you would like to diversifyyour portfolio--you might think that investing in the emerging stock marketis a good idea because it provides large diversificationbenefits.And it does because correlation is not exactly 1.However, there is still a high degreeof correlation between the US stock market and the emergingstock markets.Again, it was so, at least, historically.And if you really want to diversify,you are much better off investingin the long-term bonds or long-term ETFs,as indicated by this numbers here in this TLT ETF,because of this low negative correlation between the returnson the US stock market and on the US long-term bonds.

#### Q6, Part D-en

PROFESSOR: Now assume, on the contrary,that instead of increasing in value by 25%,the value of this clean energy ETF declined by 25%.So in this case, what is the return on your portfolio?Let's do exactly the same two steps, two calculationsto answer this question.So first, let's compute the new asset value.So this is our original value, now declined by 25%.So the new value is $48,750.The net investment, then-- so thisis the new asset value minus your borrowed amount,so the net investment is $3,750.And now, we can compute the returns.So the return is your net investmentsminus your original net investments, soyour initial wealth, divided by your, again,initial net investment of $20,000.This is -81.25%.So, if the value of this ETF declines by 25%,your returns in your portfolio is, on your initial investment,is -81.25%.So now, the final calculation hereis that it computes exactly the same return on your investmentas a function of the leverage ratio of your portfolio.So, again, leverage investment returnequals to leverage ratio times the returnon the assets in your portfolio.So, in our case, this is 3.25% multiplied by -25%.So this is the decline in the value of our asset.So this gives us -81.25%.Again, the same number as we computed here manually.

#### 415-1x_Lec_7-1_06-en

PROFESSOR: In this lecture, we develop the arbitrage pricingtheory, or APT.APT is an important theoretical model,which relates expected returns on various risky assetsto their systematic risk.In particular, APT tells us how exactlyto quantify or measure systematic riskof various assets.The main idea of the APT is to start with the factormodel of returns.Stock returns have common factors, or systematic factorsthat affect the variety of assets,and the non-systematic or firm-specific idiosyncraticfactors that affect individual assets or individual stocks.Diversification can be used to eliminate non-systematic risk,which means that diversified portfolios are onlyexposed to the common sources of risk, or factor risk.This implies that risk premia or expected excess returnson diversified portfolios depend on their exposureto systematic risk factors.This is the main result we are going to establish.Because portfolios consist of individual assets performinga variety of diversified portfolios,we can show that for almost all risky assets,expected returns also depend on their exposureto systematic factors.And that is the main result of APT,that expected excess returns or risk premia on various assetsare determined by their exposuresto systematic sources of risk, or the common return factors.Let's start by developing a factor model.Under the factor model, stock returnsare exposed to two kinds of shocks, two kinds of risk--common shocks or common factors, andasset-specific or firm-specific shocks.Let's think about common factors.These factors proxy for shocks to economic conditionswhich affect the variety of firmsand which are important to investors.Such shock could include shocks to economic growth,shocks to monetary policy or interest rates,shocks to oil price, government policy shocks, and so forth.These are common macroeconomic shocksthat affect various firms.Not necessarily in the same way, but theyare broadly important in the economy.As an example, consider an asset the price of whichrises when inflation unexpectedly accelerates.This kind of asset can be used to hedge inflation risk.An investor who buys this asset isgoing to gain some protection against inflation.As a result, we would expect that assets like theseare going to earn relatively low-risk premia because they'regoing to be in high demand by investors.The bottom line is that factors represent systematic or commonsources of risk which cannot be diversified away by formingportfolios.Firm-specific events give rise toidiosyncratic or firm-specific risks.These include events like new product innovations,lawsuits, changes in management, labor strikes, and so forth.As an example, consider a two-factor model.In this model, the two factors arerepresented by shocks to economic growthand to energy prices.In particular, the shock to growthis the unanticipated change in economic growth.So it's expected value is zero.And the same is true of the shock to energy prices.Under this model, the return on any assetis represented by its average value, Ri bar,plus the sum of two systematic terms, whichare the shock to the economic growth times the loadingon that shock, b, plus the shock to energy prices,times the loading on that shock, plus the idiosyncratic piece,of epsilon i, which represents firm-specific idiosyncraticshocks.Consider further two hypothetical firms.The first of these is the solar panel installer.This company has moderate exposureto the overall economic growth, so its loadingon the growth shock is going to be positive but perhapsnot very large.This company also benefits from an increase in energy costs.So its loading on energy prices islikely to be positive and perhaps large.The second company is a long-distance trucking firm.This company is very cyclical.Its cash flows are highly sensitive to economic activity.And as a result, its loading on the economic growth shocksis positive and large.This company is also negatively exposed to energy costs.Rising energy costs imply higher operational costsfor this firm.And so its loading on the energy shockis negative and large in absolute value.

PROFESSOR: We now take a closer lookat the technical details of factor models.Let's start with the single-factor model.We have a large number of individual assets indexed by i.One, two, three, and so forth.Returns on these assets are denoted by ri tildeto remind us that these are random.And the expect returns are denoted by ri bar.These returns are driven by a setof common or systematic factors and by idiosyncratic shocks.We denote systematic factors by capital F.These are, for example, shocks to economic growth or shocksto the value of the market portfolio and so forth.Little f represents the news component of the common factor.By definition, little f is equal to the factor value, F,minus its expected value, F bar.In other words, little f is the demeaned value of the factor.Idiosyncratic shock of each asset, epsilon i, by definitionhas zero mean.The key assumption that we make for the factor modelis that idiosyncratic shocks are truly asset-specific,which means that they are pairwise uncorrelatedacross all the assets.In other words, the covariance of epsilon iand epsilon j for two different assets i and jhas to be equal to zero.We now describe a return on any assetas a sum of its expected value, ri bar,plus the factor, F, times the loading on this factor,which is asset-specific, that's b sub i, plus the idiosyncraticshock, epsilon i.Under this model, the variance of returns on assets iconsists of two terms.The first term reflects the amount of systematic riskto which this asset is exposed.This component of the variance isequal to the square of the factorloading times the variance of the factor.That's bi squared times sigma F squared.The second term in the variance of the assetis the idiosyncratic piece.This reflects the variance of firm-specific shocks.The covariance of returns between two assets, i and j,is captured fully by their loadings on the common factor.And this is because covariance of idiosyncratic componentsof returns is zero.So what we find is that the covariance of returns in assetsi and j is given by the variance of the factor,sigma F squared, times the product of the two factorloadings, b sub i and b sub j.What we see is that under the factor structure,factor exposures determine how much asset returns canmove with each other.And that is because factors describefully the common sources of variation across the assets.On top of that, idiosyncratic risk of each assetcontributes to its own return variance.Now, we can generalize our constructionto the case of multiple factors.This is indirect analogy to the single-factor case.Again, each asset return is given by its expected valueplus the systematic component, which is nowa sum of contributions across multiple common factorsfrom one to k, and the idiosyncratic component,epsilon i.These common factors are going to affect multiple assets.Each asset has its own loadings on all of these factors, whichwe call factor betas or factor sensitivities or factorloadings.And we allow factors to be correlated with each other,so we don't make any assumptions about their joint distribution.As in the case of a single-factor model,we maintain the assumption that idiosyncratic shocks are trulyasset-specific and their pairwise covarianceacross the assets is zero.On top of that, we maintain the assumptionthat our factors are demeaned, so that the expected valueof each of these factors is zero.

#### 415-1x_Lec_7-3_05-en

PROFESSOR: We now consider the key stepin the derivation of the APT--diversification.Consider a portfolio that includes multiple riskassets, portfolio p.This portfolio is described by its weights,which we denote by w.The return of the portfolio is a weighted averageof the returns on the individual assets.Therefore, we can derive the moments of portfolio returnsfrom portfolio weights and the propertiesof the individual assets returns.In particular, the portfolio meanis a weighted average of the average returnsacross the assets in the portfolio.The factor loadings of the portfoliofor each of the factors are also weightedaverage of the individual factor loadings of the securitiesin the portfolio.And the idiosyncratic component of returns, epsilon p,is a weighted average of individual epsilons.It is this idiosyncratic piece that weare interested in right now.The variance of the idiosyncratic componentof portfolio return is the varianceof the sum of wi epsilon i, whichis the weighted average of individual epsilons.Because idiosyncratic shocks are pairwiseuncorrelated across the assets, the variance of the sumis equal to the sum of variances.In other words, the variance of the idiosyncratic componentof portfolio return is a sum across allof the assets of the individual idiosyncratic variances,variance of epsilon i times the square of portfolio weight.Now, let's specialize this resultto the case of an equally weighted portfolio.Suppose that each of the portfolio weights, wi,is equal to 1/N, where N is the number of assetsin the portfolio.We're going to need a piece of notation.We will denote the average idiosyncratic varianceacross all of the assets by sigma i squared bar.Now, as it is clear from the previous derivation,the variance of the idiosyncratic componentof portfolio return is equal to 1/N times the averageidiosyncratic variance.As we let the number of securities increase and Nrises, this number goes to 0.In other words, as we enlarge the portfolioby adding more and more assets equally weighted,the non-systematic component of variance vanishes in the limit.This result does not depend on the portfoliobeing exactly equally weighted.The same argument can be applied to any well-diversifiedportfolio, as long as the maximum portfolioweight decreases as the number of assets in the portfoliorises.In other words, all that we requireis that the portfolio weights are more or less evenlydistributed across the assets, but they don't needto be exactly equally weighted.What we determined is that in a well-diversifiedportfolio for a specific or idiosyncratic riskcan be eliminated as the number of assets in the portfolioincreases.This is an important property of well-diversified portfolios.They don't have idiosyncratic risk, at leastin the limit of a large number of assets.The only risk that affects well-diversified portfoliosis the factor risk or systematic risk.This is the kind of risk that cannot be diversified awayby forming portfolios with a large number of assets.To illustrate, consider the following empirical example.We construct two portfolios by sorting stocks on their marketcapitalization, or market size.We start in 1926.Portfolio 1 includes the largest stocks in the US stock market.This portfolio is based roughly on the top 30% in termsof market capitalization judging by the distribution of marketcap on the New York Stock Exchange.In recent years, this portfolio included approximately 500stocks.The second portfolio includes the lower tierin terms of market size.This portfolio, we can call it mid cap,includes roughly 1,000 stocks.These two portfolios are well-diversified.And by construction, they do not overlap.A stock can be either in Portfolio 1or Portfolio 2 or neither.They have no securities in common.If return distribution in the stock marketcan be described by a single factor model, thenboth of these portfolios, being well-diversified,will have exposure to the common factorand no idiosyncratic risk.In other words, these two portfoliosshould be perfectly correlated with each other.The exposures to the common factormay not be the same in magnitude,but the returns should be perfectly correlated.As we look at the scatter plot of the return distributionof the mid cap portfolio on the vertical axisrelative to the large cap portfolioon the horizontal axis, we observethat, indeed, the returns on these two portfoliosare highly correlated with each other.They're not perfectly correlated as a single factormodel will predict, but the correlation is very high.And the R squared of a regressionof the mid cap return on the large cap return is over 90%.Observe that the slope of the line thatcaptures the linear relation between these two portfoliosis higher than 1.What this means is that the mid cap portfoliohas a higher loading on the common factorthan the large cap portfolio.These results suggest that there is a significant common factorthat affects returns on large cap and mid cap stocks.And even though these two portfolioshave no securities in common, their returns with each otherare highly correlated.We also see that the correlation is not perfect.And that suggests that perhaps there are other factors at playhere and a single factor model does not fullydescribe the return distribution of these two portfolios.

#### 415-1x_Lec_7-4_05-en

PROFESSOR: We now develop a resultthat relates expected returns on well-diversified portfoliosto their systematic risk.Let's start with an example, and use an arbitrage argumentto establish this kind of relation.In our example, there are two portfolios, A and B.And there is a single common source of risk,that is a single common factor.We assume that the expected excess return--recall that excess returns are measured relativeto the risk-free rate.The expected excess return on portfolio A is 5%.And for portfolio B it is 8%.The loading on the common factor is 1 for portfolio Aand 2 for portfolio B.We want to argue that with this set of assumptions,the market contains arbitrage.Let's consider the following arbitrage strategy.We're going to borrow $1 at the risk-free rate.We are going to short $1 of portfolioB and invest $2 into portfolio A.By construction, this strategy doesn't require any capital.We borrow $1, raise another dollar by shorting,and invest the $2 in portfolio A.Let's consider the payoff of this strategy next period.The payoff from borrowing $1 is going to be minus 1plus the risk-free rate.The payoff from shorting portfolio B is minus 1plus the risk-free rate, plus the risk premium on portfolioB, plus the factor loading, whichis 2, times the realization of the factor, F.This is multiplied by the scale of our investment, which is $1.The payoff from our investment in portfolio Ais going to be 1 plus RF plus the 5% risk premium,plus the factor loading, which is 1,times the realization of the factor, F, multiplied by $2.When we sum up all of these payoffs across the threelegs of our position, we find that the effect of the factordisappears, that exposure cancels out,and we're left with $0.02.In other words, we started with no capitaland we constructed a portfolio with three positions in it,which pays $0.02 next period with no risk.This is arbitrage or free lunch.The reason why we were able to find arbitrageis that expected excess returns on our portfoliosand their factor loadings were not consistent with each other.We will now generalize this resultand establish a relation between factor loadingsand expected returns, which is neededin order to avoid arbitrage.In particular, we want to show that expected excess returnsand factor loadings have to be linearly related.For a single-factor model, this meansthat for any portfolio, p, the expected excess returnhas to be equal to its factor loading,b sub p, times a constant, lambda.This constant has to be common to all portfolios.To see why this needs to be the case,we're going to repeat the arbitrageargument similar to the one that we just discussedfor our particular example.Suppose that for another portfolio, portfolio q,the risk premium is equal to its factor loading,b sub q, times a different constant, lambda prime.Lambda prime and lambda are not the same.Assume also that b sub q, the loading on the factor,is non-zero.Now, we create a three-legged arbitrage.We'll short $1 of portfolio p.We buy bp over bq dollars of portfolio q.And we borrow, bp over bq minus 1.As you can see, this portfolio, this entire trade,does not require any capital.It is self-financing.As we look at its payoff, we observethat the payoff from the first investment, $1 in portfolio p,plus the second investment, the investment in portfolio q,plus the risk-free component, whenwe sum them up, have the propertythat there is no exposure to the factor remaining,and the payoff is in fact a constant.It's equal to lambda prime minus lambda times b sub p.To avoid arbitrage, this constanthas to be equal to zero.A zero-investment portfolio without risk cannot producenon-zero payoffs.We conclude that lambda prime and lambdahave to be the same to avoid arbitrage.We have established an important result. Thatin a frictionless market with a single-factor structureof returns, in order to avoid arbitrage risk premium on allwell-diversified portfolios have to be givenby a product of the factor loading of the portfolioand a common constant, lambda.The factor loading represents the quantityof risk in each portfolio.It's a measure of systematic risk.Lambda tells us how much compensation a portfoliois going to earn per unit of systematic risk.We call lambda the price of risk or the market price of riskor the factor risk premium.Our pricing result can be extendedto multi-factor models.The result is very similar.The risk premium on any well-diversified portfoliois based on its factor exposures.In particular, it is a sum across allof the common factors, or the factor loadingtimes the corresponding factor premium or price of risk.These factor exposures describe systematic riskof the portfolio.Now, in contrast to the single-factor case,this is a vector.A portfolio is characterized by a vector of its risk exposures.We need to know how a portfolio loads on each of the factorsto fully describe its risk.And each of these risk exposures carries its own risk premium.Different factors don't earn the same compensationfor their risk exposures.The intuition of this result is that wecould construct multiple portfolios with identical riskexposures.To avoid arbitrage, the expected returns have to be the same.This means that expected return or the risk premiumon any diversified portfolio mustbe determined by its exposure to the common factors.

PROFESSOR: Next, we discuss estimationof factor risk premia.How can we learn about prices of riskassociated with the various systematic factors.APT relation tells us that the risk premiaon various diversified portfoliosare based on their effect to exposures and their associatedprices of risk.We can therefore use market returns,market prices to recover the implied riskpremia which are attached to all of these systematic factors.To see how this can be done, consider the following example.Suppose we have two common factors.As before, it's a shock to economic growthand a shock to energy prices.We start with the APT relation, that the risk premiumis a linear combination of factor loadings weightedby prices of risk.Now, suppose we observe two well-diversified portfolios,A and B. The expected returns on these portfoliosare 12% and 10%, respectively.And the risk-free interest rate is 2%.The factor loadings for portfolio Aare 1 on the growth shock and 1.25 on the energy shock.And for portfolio B, it's 2 on the growth shock and minus 0.5the energy shock.We want to use this data to recoverfactor risk premia for the growth shock and the energyshock.The APT relation tells us that the expected excess returnon asset A, which is 12% minus 2%is equal to its loading on the growth shock, whichis 1, times the price of risk of the shock, which is unknown,that's lambda of the growth shock,plus 1.25, which is the loading on the energy shock,times the price of risk of that shock.That gives us one equation that relates risk premia on the twofactors to the expected excess return of portfolio A.We do the same for portfolio B and obtain a second relation.We have a system of two equationson the two unknown prices of risk that you can solve.And we find the unique solution.The risk premium associated with the energy shock is 4%.And the risk premium on the growth shock is 5%.To avoid arbitrage, all other portfoliosmust have expected returns consistent with these factorrisk premia.For example, if we have a third portfolio, portfolio C,with a growth loading of one and the energy shockloading of 0.5, then the risk premium on this portfoliohas to be equal to 1 times the premium on the growth shock,plus 0.5 times the premium on the energy shock, or 7%.What we see is that the risk premia associatedwith the various risk factors canbe recovered from risk premia on well-diversified portfolios.

PROFESSOR: We next introduce an important concept,a factor-mimicking portfolio.So far, our common factors didn'tneed to be traded assets.They could be macroeconomic shocks.They could also be returns on financial assets.It turns out that we can replace any common shockwith a corresponding return on the financial portfolio.This portfolio is called the factor-mimicking portfolio.Let's see how it can be done.Consider a case of a single-factor model.We can visualize the APT relation graphically.On the graph, on the horizontal axis,we plot the factor exposure, b sub p.On the vertical axis, we plot the expected returnson the portfolios, r bar p.The relation between expected portfolio returnsand the factor loading is linear.For the portfolio with zero-factor loading,the return is equal to the risk-free rate.This is the point on the vertical axis.And for the portfolios with positive factor loadings,average returns are positive and increasing with the magnitudeof the factor risk exposure.Consider one of these portfolios with a factorloading equal to one.Under the APT relation, the risk premium on this portfoliohas to be equal to the risk premium of the factor,or lambda.We can therefore see that the portfoliowith the factor loading equal to one or with the unit factorbeta can be used as a factor-mimicking portfolio.The risk premium on this portfoliois equal to the price of risk of the factor.Moreover, because this portfolio is perfectlycorrelated with the factor, we can use itinstead of the factor in the APT relation itself.In other words, we can replace the factorby its mimicking portfolio in our factor model.Next, we generalize the argument of the caseof a multi-factor model.We start with the model with the K factors.And we consider K portfolios--P1, P2, and so forth--which are linearly independent.Our objective is to construct mimicking portfoliosfor each of the common factors.Once we do that, the expected excess returnson these portfolios are going to tell us the risk premiafor the associated factors.To construct a mimicking portfolio for factor j,we need to build a portfolio with the propertythat its loading on factor j is equal to one.And its loadings on all the other factorsare equal to zero.This can be expressed algebraicallyas a system of equations.The factor loading of the portfoliois equal to the weighted average of the factorloadings of the individual assets or the portfoliocomponents.In our case, these assets are portfolios P1, P2, through PK.So consider the exposure to factor one.We have the weight of the first portfolio multipliedby its loading on the first factor,plus the weight of the second portfolio multipliedby its loading on the first factor, and so forth.The equation tells us that the loadingof the portfolio on the first factor is equal to zero.We do the same for each of the factors.Factor j is special.The loading on that factor is equal to one.The loadings on all the other factors are zero.We have a system of equations with K unknowns and Kequations.We can find a unique solution.This allows us to construct factor-mimicking portfolios.To see how a procedure would work,let's apply it to our previous example.We have two portfolios, A and B. And two common factors,a growth shock and an energy shock.Portfolio A has a loading of 1 and 1.25are the two factors, respectively.Portfolio B has the loadings of 2 and minus 0.5.We want to build a factor-mimicking portfoliofor the energy shock.This portfolio has a weight of wA on portfolio A and wBon portfolio B.It must have zero exposure to the growth shock,and the unit exposure to the energy shock.These two conditions can be expressed as two equations.For the growth shock we have the weighton portfolio A multiplied by the beta of that portfolio, whichis one, plus the weight on portfolio B,multiplied by the beta of that portfolio, which is two.And the sum of these exposures has to be equal to zero.For the energy shock, we have similar logic.1.25, which is the loading of portfolio A multipliedby the weight of A in the portfolio minus 0.5times the weight of B is equal to one.We solve the system equations to findthat the weight on portfolio A is 2/3, 0.67.And the weight of portfolio B is minus 0.33.Notice that these weights do not sum up to one,and that is because in our constructionwe are implicitly using a risk-free asset.So as we add up the weights, the residual,the difference between one and the sum of these weightshas to be invested in the risk-free asset.In this particular example, we find a mimicking portfoliofor the energy factor which has weights of 2/3 on portfolio Aand minus 1/3 on portfolio B. And thatimplies that the risk premium on the energy factoris equal to 4%, which is exactly the same result that wefollowed previously by computing the risk premia impliedby the expected returns on portfolios A and B.

PROFESSOR: We now extend the APT result to individual assets.Let's recap.So far, we established that absenceof arbitrage out of the assumption of factor modelsimplies that the risk premium on all well diversifiedportfolios, have to be determined by their factorloadings and the risk premium on individual factors.What economists say about risk premiumon individual securities?It turns out that the same relationhas to apply to almost all individual securities.This result is what is called the arbitrage price and theory.And it was developed by Stephen Ross in 1976.To see the intuition for why APT relation musthold for individual assets, at leastfor most individual assets, supposethat this relation is violated.If APT relation is violated for many individual assets,we should be able to find many securities for which expectedasset return is not equal to the sum of factor loadingsand factor risk premium.There is going to be an extra term, which we call an alpha.Alpha captures the degree of violation of the APT pricingrelation.We also think of alpha as a measure of mispricing,relative to the APT pricing formula.Suppose that many assets have a non-zero alpha.To be specific, let's say that many assetshave a positive alpha.Our argument is going to be exactly analogousif these alphas are negative.Let's collect all of these securitieswith positive alphas, and combine them into an equallyweighted portfolio.Call this portfolio, p star.The risk premium on this portfoliois a weighted average of the riskpremium of individual assets.As it is out, we see that the risk premium on this portfoliois given by the average alpha across the securities,plus the term that reflects the factor exposures,or the portfolio P star.In other words, we were able to construct a portfolio pstar for which the APT relation is violated.The risk premium on this portfoliois not equal to the sum across the factors of the factorloading times the risk premium.There is an extra term, the non-zero alpha.What this means is that if the APT relation is violatedfor a large number of individual assets,it is going to be violated for someof all diversified portfolios and thatas we concluded before would lead to arbitrage.We therefore conclude that the APT formula, the relationbetween expected returns and factor loadings,must hold for almost all individual assets.

PROFESSOR: We will now discuss the empirical implementationof APT and consider a couple of important examples.As we implement APT empirically, we need to take three steps.First, we need to choose or identify the common factors.Common factors are the economic variables, or the mimickingportfolios that we think affect a broad cross-section of assetreturns.At that point, we need to make a choice.How many factors to use and which factors are important.There is no clear recipe for this choice.There are several techniques that could be used.You could use prior information about common economic shocks,macro-factors that may be relevant.You could use statistical techniquesto help us choose which common factors areimportant for describing the cross-section of returnsand how many of them to use.The choice of the number and the nature of factorsis outside of the APT framework itself.So we need to use other considerationsto choose the factors.The second step is estimation of factor loadings.We need to use statistical techniquesto figure out how various assets load on the common factors.Typically, this is done by runninga time-series regression of portfolio returnson the factors.The third step is to estimate risk premia.We do this usually by regressing returnson various assets on the factor loadings.This kind of cross-sectional regressionreveals the compensation for exposureto each individual factor.At the end, we end up with an assessment of which factorsare important for describing the cross-section of returnsand how much compensation is earned by various risk factors.As the first example of the implementation of APT,consider a macro-factor model.This was the model developed by Chen, Roll, and Rossin the 1986 article.In this model, they have several common factors.In addition to the market factor,they consider a number of macroeconomic factorssuch as shocks in industrial production,changes in expected and unexpected inflation,as well as changes in the risk premium, which theyproxy by the difference in returns between bonds ratedBaa and lower and long-term governmentbonds and unexpected changes in the term premium whichare the differences in returns between long-term governmentbonds and T-bills.The data sample covers the period from 1953 to 1984.The next step in the analysis is to estimate betason the asset of diversifiable portfolios.The portfolios they choose are equity portfoliossorted on the market capitalization of the stocks.They construct 20 portfolios, startingfrom the 5% of the smallest firmsand going all the way up to the 5% of the largest firms.They run a time series regressionof returns on each of these portfolioson the corresponding factors.In this regression, they use five years of monthly datato estimate the current value of de facto loadings for eachof these portfolios.As a result of this analysis, theyobtain estimates of factor betas for each of the factors,for each of the portfolios in the data set each month.Next, the paper estimates factor risk premia.We have 20 diversified portfolios basedon the market cap of the firms.For each of these portfolios we haveestimates of the factor loadings for each of the factors.So each month we run the cross-sectional regressionof portfolio returns on the corresponding factor loadings.The slope, coefficients in this regression, the lambdasestimate the factor risk premia.After running this regression each month,we average the results across timeto find an estimate of the average risk premium associatedwith each of the factors.The result of this analysis is that allof the economic factors used in the model appear to be priced.There is a compensation attached to exposuresto all of these factors.We also see that various factors have different prices of risk.And in fact, they are different inside.Some of them are positive.Others are negative.The APT model itself does not tell us how and why these riskpremia are determined.Why is it that one of the factorshas a large positive risk premium?And the other has a negative risk premium?To understand where these risk premia are coming from,we need to think about the economics of risk exposuresand how they're compensated in the market.Again, the APT as a pricing modelis not concerned with the sources of risk premia.It simply tells us that expected excess returnson various portfolios of various assetshave to be consistent with each other.They have to be consistent with the factor risk premia.Where these premia are coming from is outside of the model.Having said that, we can make some sense of the magnitude,and in particular the sign of the risk premiaassociated with different factors.For example, if we look at the Industrial production, that'sthe MP factor in the model, we seethat the risk premium for this factor is positive.What this means is that the securities thattend to fall in value at a time when thereis a negative shock to industrial productiontend to earn relatively higher returns.This is fairly intuitive.The times when industrial production declinesare usually the times of economic downturns.And assets that lose value preciselyat the same time when the entire economy is not doing wellare less desirable.They have to earn a relatively high average rate of returnto compensate their investors for holding that kind of risk.We can think in a similar way about exposuresto other kinds of risk factors and whythey're compensated positively or negatively with their riskpremia.We observe another important result herethat the market factor, the first factorin the table, that's the value weighted portfolio of stocks,doesn't seem to be priced after we controlfor the other economic factors.What this means is that whatever economic shocks are drivingthe market portfolio, it seems to becaptured by the other factors in the model.And after controlling for the exposure to the other factors,exposure to the market is not compensatedwith an additional risk premium.

PROFESSOR: Our second example is a famous modeldeveloped by Fama and French.We're going to use a couple of papers from 1993 and '96to describe their construction.In, this model, factors are not drivenby macroeconomic variables.Or rather, they're not explicitly definedin terms of macroeconomic variables.But instead, factors are constructedas portfolios of stocks.In other words, in this analysis,we directly build factor-mimicking portfoliosrather than starting with the economically motivated factors.Fama and French design their factor-mimicking portfoliosby sorting firms on two characteristics--size and the book-to-market ratio.Size in this case corresponds to the market capitalizationof the stock.And the book-to-market ratio is the ratio of the book valueof equity to its market value.The idea, the premise behind this construction,is that firms with different characteristics-- small firmsversus large firms, high book-to-market firmsversus low book-to-market firms have different exposuresto important macroeconomic factors.And therefore, by sorting these characteristicsand by building portfolios, we canconstruct mimicking portfolios for the underlying macrofactors.Of course, we don't quite know what these factors are,but we can nonetheless use the mimicking portfoliosin a statistical manner to build factor models.We end up with a three-factor model.The first factor is the value-weighted market returnminus the return on the T-Bill.We call it RM minus Rf.The second factor, which is called SMB, small minus big,is a long-short portfolio, which has long small-cap stocksand short large-cap stocks.The third portfolio, HML, or high minus low,is a portfolio which has long high book-to-market firmsand short low book-to-market firms.High book-to-market firms are what is called value firms.And the low book-to-market firms are called growth firms.So this is a value minus growth portfolio.These portfolios-- the market minus the risk-free rate,small minus big, and high minus low--seem to earn significant risk premia.Over the sample period considered in the paper,the risk premium on the market is 0.43%,the premium on the SMB portfolio is 0.27%,and the premium on HML, the value factor is 0.4%.All of these monthly numbers.We can see that these premia are economically largeand they are also statistically significant.We now consider an application of the three-factor Fama-Frenchmodel.In their construction, they use stocksfrom NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ from a period from 1963 to '91.And they built 25 portfolios.These portfolios are sorted on size and book-to-market ratios.For each of these 25 portfolios, they'reon the regression of the excess portfolio return, that'sthe portfolio return minus the risk-free rate,on the three common factors, the market factor, the SMB,small minus big portfolio factor,and HML, the value factor.After earning these regressions, wecan evaluate the loadings on the factors to see to what extentvarious portfolios have different loadingson the common factors, and the intercepts or the alphas.If the APT model describes risk premia on these 25 portfoliosaccurately, these alphas should be close to zero.In the first table which would takefrom the Fama-French paper, we see the distributionof average returns across the 25 portfolios sortedon size and book-to-market.What we see is that as we go from low to high valuesof the market cap, portfolio returns decline.In other words, small stocks tendto earn relatively higher returnscompared to the large stocks.Value stocks, which are the companieswith the high book-to-market ratio,tend to earn relatively high returnscompared to the growth stocks.In other words, there is a significant degreeof heterogeneity in average returns across these 25portfolios.This is what the APT model, the three-factor model,is going to try to explain.We observed that there is a significant amountof heterogeneity in the factor loadings across the 25portfolios.While the loadings on the market appearto be relatively similar, the loadingson the SMB and the HML factor are quite different.This is not surprising.The SMB factor is a long-short portfolioof small versus large firms.Small stocks tend to have a positive exposureto this portfolio return, and large stockstend to have a negative exposure.Similar logic applies to the HML portfolio and their exposuresalong the dimensions of high versuslow market-to-book ratios.The important numbers for us hereare the R-squared in the regression of portfolioreturns for these 25 size and book-to-market portfolioson the common factors.These R-squared numbers are quite high.They are often in excess of 90%.What this is telling us is that the three factors--the market, SMB, and HML--are doing a very good job at capturing returnvariation of these 25 portfolios, which is somethingwe would expect in a three-factor APT worldbecause each of these 25 portfolios is well-diversified.And therefore, their returns should be well explainedby the common factors.In this final table, we'll look at the intercepts in the timeseries regression of the returns on each of these 25 portfolioson the three common factors--the market, SMB and HML.If you compare this to the analysis of the Chen, Roll,and Ross model, this is a different technique.Instead of regressing asset returns cross-sectionallyon the factor loadings, we are running a time seriesregression where we're regressing each portfolioreturn on the common factors.Under the APT model, the interceptof this regression or the alpha should be equal to zero.Of course, in any statistical exercise,we have estimation errors.And so the intercept in this regressionis not going to be literally equal to zero.But we can think about statistical tests of howdifferent these are from zero.We can also think economically howsignificant these deviations from zero may be.What we find is that for most of the 25 portfolios,the intercept, the alpha, is in fact quite close to zero.Economically and statistically indistinguishable from zero.There are a couple of exceptions that we observe, particularlyfor small stock portfolios.So what this is telling us is that by and large,the cross-sectional differences in returns on the 25 portfolioscan be well described by a three-factor model.There are some violations that we'reobserving for small stocks.So perhaps, a three-factor model is not a perfect descriptionof expected returns here.Nonetheless, it does capture to a significant degreethe amount of cross-sectional variation in the returnsacross these portfolios.We have looked at a couple of examplesof how the APT framework can be appliedto determine expected excess returns on various assets.We didn't go into the technical details of how exactlyregressions are set up an estimated.What we wanted to illustrate is the concept.That risk premier of various common factorscan be inferred from the history of returns on financial assets.There are multiple techniques that could be used for that--cross-sectional regressions, time series regressions.One of the bottlenecks of the APTis that the theory doesn't tell uswhere the factors are coming fromor how many factors we need.Making those choices requires some understandingof the economics of the problem andfurther statistical analysis.At the end of the day, APT is a frameworkwhich is rather flexible and can be usedin a variety of circumstances.It enforces the notion that absence of arbitrageimposes a strong restriction of how expected excess returns arerelated to risk exposures.This logic is quite robust, and it shows upacross a variety of asset pricing models.In this way, the APT framework provides a general templateof how risk premia or expected returns canbe related to measures of risk.

PROFESSOR: In this question, we will considera frame over a factor model.And I will teach you how to compute standard deviationsand correlations of returns on individual assetsor individual stocks.We will start with a two-factor model.So the volatility of the first factor,or the standard deviation of factor 1 is 7%.The volatility of the second factor is 5%.There are two stocks, A and B. Stock Ahas the following loadings.So it has a loading of 1 on factor 1 and loading of 1.5on factor 2.The idiosyncratic volatility of the stock A is 25%.Stock B has loading of 2, or its beta on the first factorequals to 2.And the loading on factor 2 equals to 3.The idiosyncratic risk of the volatility of the stock Bis 10%.In the first question, we'll compute the standard deviationsof returns of these two stocks, so stock A and stock B. Let'sstart with writing down the expression for the varianceof returns on stock A. The returns on stock Aare given by the following, again, factormodel, the following expression.So we need to compute the variance of this.So this is a scalar because this is the expectedvalue of random variable ri.So the variance of this is going to be 0.So then we are left with these three expressions.So we will have the variances of these individual termsplus the pairwise covariances.So let's start with the first term.So the variance of this is going to be equal to beta,or the first loading, beta 1 squared,multiplied by the variance of the first factor of 1plus the second beta, the second loading squared multipliedby this variance, plus the varianceof these idiosyncratic components, so idiosyncraticrisk--so this is the last part here-- so varianceof epsilon A, plus pairwise correlations.So the first one would be the covariance between the returnson factor 1 and factor 2.So this is 2 times the betas times the covariancebetween the returns on factor 1 and the returns on factor 2.And plus the covariance is between f1and the idiosyncratic risk of stock A,so epsilon A, and f2 and epsilon 2.Now by construction, remember that this is a factor model.So by definition, the covariance isbetween the returns and factors and idiosyncratic risk.This is why it is idiosyncratic risk.So this covariance, it will be 0.Now in addition to this--so recall that when we discussed this in the lecture,we said that in theory, returns and factors, of course,could be correlated.But here we'll assume that this covariance would equal to 0.So that the returns on factors f1and f2 in this particular example would be uncorrelated.So I'll get rid of this term.Now, let's compute the variance of returns on stock A.Since we assume that the covariance or the correlationbetween the returns on factor 1 and 2is 0, so these two factors are uncorrelated,we are left with just these three terms.So to compute the variance for stock A,we're taking first beta or the loading on the first factor,squaring it, so 1 squared, multiply itby the variance of the first factor.So we're given a standard deviation, 7%.So we're squaring the 7%.Plus we have the second beta, 1.5, square it,multiplying it by the variance of the second factor,this is the standard deviation that we are given, squared.Plus the variance of the idiosyncratic risk of stock A,this is 25% squared.Computing this gives us 0.073%.So this is the variance.To find the standard deviation of the returns on the stock A,we are taking the square root of this variance, square rootof 0.073.And this gives us 27%.So therefore, the volatility of the returns on this stock Ais 27%.We can repeat this calculation for stock B.So it's exactly the same expression.So I take the first beta or the loading on the first factor,multiplying it with the variance of the first factorthe loading on the second factor squared, multiplyingby the variance of the returns of the second factor, so 5%squared.Plus idiosyncratic variance, it's 10% squared.Computing this gives us 0.052%.So this is the variance of returns on stock B.To find the standard deviation, we'retaking the square root of this, which gives us 22.8%.So the volatility of the returns on stock B is 22.8%.Now notice that the volatility of returns on the first stockis higher than the volatility of the returnson the second stock, even though stock B seemsto be risky because it has, or at leastin terms of systematic risk, it has much higher loadingson systematic returns factors.But, of course, what makes stock A overall riskierthan stock B is the fact that it has much higher idiosyncraticvolatility, 25% versus 10% for stock B.So that directly feeds into overall higher risk for stock Acompared to the overall risk for stock B.

#### 415-1x_Rec 7_Q1, Part B-en

PROFESSOR: Let's compute correlationbetween the returns on stock A and stockB. I will start with the covariance.So the covariance between returns on stock A and stockB will be given by this expression.I got this expression by taking the expressionthat we get from the factor modelfrom the return structure.So the return on stock A is given by this equation and sothe return for stock B.The first, so this expected value is notgoing to matter because this is justa scalar and the idiosyncratic component epsilonis not going to matter here as well for the covariance termbecause by definition the covariance between returnson stock A and B is 0 [NOTE: Professor meant covariance between idiosyncratic components of returns], is just the definitionof idiosyncratic risk.And there is no correlation between factor returnsand idiosyncratic risk for either of the two stocks.Again, just by the definition of what is factor returnand what is the idiosyncratic risk.And so therefore, we are left with the following expressions,so the covariance of the returns on stock A and Bwould be given by just effectively these twoexpressions.So for the first stock we get beta A with respectto factor 1, multiplied by f1, then the second beta multipliedby factor 2.And for stock B we get beta B1 multiplied by f1 and beta B2multiplied by f2.Now this covariance in turn is goingto equal to this simple expression for the reasonthat again we're assuming that the returns in factor f1 and f2are uncorrelated, so the covariance is 0.If it is not, then this expression,we will have to take into account this covariance aswell.Again, assuming that this is 0, so what's leftis just simply the variance of f1 multiplied by the factorloadings of stock A and B on factor 1, so beta A1,beta B1 multiplied by the variance of f1,plus the same for the second factor.So beta A2 times beta B2, multipliedby the variance of factor f2.Computing this, again, so we know betas,we know the variances of factor of f1 and f2.So this gives us 0.021.And so this is the covariance.The final step is take the covarianceand compute the correlation.Correlation by definition equals to the covarianceof returns on A and B divided by their standard deviations.We have computed standard deviationsin the first part of this questionso we know these numbers.So we're taking this covariance that we justcomputed, dividing it by the standard deviationthat we computed in part A and this gives me 0.341.So therefore the correlation between the returnson stock A and stock B is 34%.

PROFESSOR: In this question, we willwork with a large portfolio of stockswith the goal to understand what happens to the idiosyncratic,the risk of a portfolio as the number of stocksin the portfolio increases.We will start with a portfolio that consists of 30 stocks.We will work with in the framework of a two factormodel.And we have the following factor loadings and standard deviationof idiosyncratic risk for individual assets for these 30stocks.So the factor loading on the first factor, beta 1,for each of the assets, for each of the 30 stocks, equals to 1.Now the factor loading on the second factor for these 30stocks will differ.So for the first 10 stocks, from i from 1 to 10,the factor loading will be 1.For the next 10 stocks, from i equals to 11 to 20,the vector loading will be 1.6.And for the remaining 10 stocks from 21 to 30,the factor loading on the second factor will be 2.1.This is the idiosyncratic risk of our individual stocks.For the first 10 stocks, idiosyncratic standarddeviation is 5%.For the next 10 stocks, from 11 to 20, it's 6%.And for the remaining 10 stocks, it is 8%.So first, what we will do here isthat we'll form an equally weighted portfolio outof these 10 stocks.And in the first question, we'll tryto understand what are the factorloadings on factor 1 and 2, in this equallyweighted portfolio.Let's compute factor loadings of this equallyweighted portfolio.Let's start with the factor loading 1 or beta 1,of portfolio p.By definition, this is just the weighted averageof betas of individual assets in our portfolio.The weights are the weights of each of the individual assetsin the portfolio.So all of our w's, would just simply equal to 1 over n1,where n1 is the number of stocks, 30,because we're working with equally weighted portfolios.And so therefore, this expressionbecomes just the sum from 1 all the way to 30to the number of stocks, 1 over n1,which is the weight of each individual stock, multipliedby the beta of individual stocks in this portfolio.Now recall that of beta, all of the loadings,so if individual stocks on factor 1,is just simply equal to 1.So all of this beta i1, they're equal to 1.And so therefore, the sum becomes just this.So we're adding up from 1 to 30, 1 over 30.So this just gives us 1.And you could see that this is very intuitivebecause each individual stock is betathat it goes to 1 with respect to the first factor.So for equally weighted portfolio,for that matter, for any portfolio that we form outof these assets, the beta, 1, of this portfoliowill always be equal to 1, just because individual assets, allof them have betas equal to 1.Now for beta 2 of the portfolio isgoing to be a little bit differentbecause individual stocks have different loadingson the second factor here.So let's compute it.Same expression, this is just definition.Equally weighted portfolio, so all of our wi's are 1 over n1.And now we are adding up all of these beta, i2.So we have 10 stocks for which beta i2 is 1.So 10 times 1.The other 10 stocks of which beta 2 is 1.6.So 10 times 1.6 plus 10 times 2.1.So this is the beta for the last 30 stocks in this portfolio.So if we add up all this, we divided by 30.Again, so this is the number of stocks.So this expression would equal to 1.57.So the loading on the second factor of this portfolio p,equally weighted portfolio, would equal to 1.57.

PROFESSOR: Now what I will do right now,I will increase the number of stocks from 30 to 300.I will maintain the assumption that the loadingson the first factor for each of these 300 stocksright now is still one and I will maintain the same loadingstructure on the second factor but Iwill assume that for the first 100 stocksthe second beta, beta 2 is equal to 1.For the next 100 stocks, so from 101 to 200, the beta is 1.6,and from 201 to 300, so for the last 100 stocks, beta 2 is 2.1.Right now I want to understand whathappens to betas of the portfolio, the factor loadings,of this equally weighted portfolio on factor 1and factor 2.And so let's see, for the first factorwe get, it's exactly the same expressionbecause it's an equally weighted portfolio,so all that changes is just n1.So before it was 30, right now it's 300.And you can see that this expression againis going to be equal to 1 because we'readding 1 over 300.So this is the weight that we put in each individual stock,300 times.Before we were doing it 30 times.And so this sum is just equal to 1.And again, this should be intuitivethat if each of the individual stocks have factor loading of 1on the first factor, then again, if we combine theminto a portfolio, the portfolio loading on factor 1is going to be just simply equal to 1 as well.For equal weighted portfolio but thenagain for any other portfolio as well.Now let's see what happens to the factor loadingon the second factor.So this is the same expression as wehad before again, n1 right now is 300, but all we're doingis that we are adding the second beta for eachof the individual stocks and so here we're doing,we're adding it 100 times for the first asset,so it's 100 times 1, then 100 times 1.6for the second class of stocks and thenanother 100 multiplied by 2.1.So this is for the last class of stocks with this beta.And so then all we're doing is that we're adding this upand we're dividing it by n1, which right now is 300.And you can see that this is just,it's a simple scaling compared to the casethat we had before when we had 30 stocks, so wewere multiplying by 10 and were dividing by 30, right nowwe're multiplying it by 100 and dividing it by 300.So this doesn't change the final answerthat the beta, second beta the loadingof this portfolio in the second factor is 1.57.So this doesn't change.So the result here is that as we increasethe number of stocks in this portfolio from 30 to 300 factorloadings stay the same.

PROFESSOR: Let's find idiosyncratic volatilityof an equally weighted portfolio.So we're after standard deviation of epsilon Pand we'll start with the varianceand then we'll take the square root of itto find the standard deviation.So let's start with the variance.By definition since idiosyncratic risksof individual assets are uncorrelated,the variance or idiosyncratic risk of the portfolio Pwould equal to the sum of the individual idiosyncraticvariances of each individual stocks, multipliedby the squared weights that we have in the portfolio.And so recall that again, all Wis are just 1 over 30,or 1 over n1, and so therefore, each of these wi squared, whichis equal to 1 over n1 squared.And now what we are left with is justthe sum of idiosyncratic variances of individual stocks.And this is the structure.So the first 10 stocks have the standard deviationof 5%, idiosyncratic standard deviation of 5%.The next 10 stocks 6% and the remaining 10 stocks 8%.So if we add up all of them.So we get 10 times 5% squared, so this is the varianceof these first 10 stocks.Then 10 times 6% squared, so this is the total varianceof the second stocks.And then 10 times 8% squared, so this is the varianceof the remaining 10 stocks.Again, so n1 equals t0 30, so 1 over 30 squared,putting this all together gives us 0.00014.And so this is the variance or idiosyncratic varianceof this portfolio P.To find the standard deviation, we'rejust taking the square root of this number that we found hereand we get number 1.18%.So the idiosyncratic volatility of this equallyweighted portfolio P equals to 1.18%.Notice how much lower it is comparedto the individual idiosyncratic variancesof each individual assets.The lowest one is 5% and so this portfolio right nowhas very low variance, idiosyncratic varianceof just 1.18%.

#### 415-1x_Rec 7_Q2, Part D-en

PROFESSOR: Now let's see what happens to the idiosyncraticvolatility of a portfolio as we increase the number of stocks.We will increase it from 30 to 300and we'll compute the idiosyncratic volatility, againof this equally weighted portfolio.I will maintain the assumption that the first 100 stocks haveidiosyncratic volatility of 5%, the next 100 stocks 6%,and the remaining 100 stocks of 8%.So this is a standard deviation of epsilon Iof these individual stocks.Now let's see what changes in the expressionthat we've had before.So one thing that changes is n1, so instead of 30, itbecomes 300 and so I'm raising, I'msquaring 300 right now instead of 30.And now I'm adding up instead of adding up30 idiosyncratic variances, I'm addingup 300 idiosyncratic variances because I have 300 stocks.And so the first 100 stocks have idiosyncratic varianceof 5% squared.So the remaining, or the next 100 stocks 6%squared, and the last 100 stocks 8% squared.So adding this all up gives me this variance.You can see that already this variance is quite a bit smallerthan this one because it has an extra 0 here.And so now if I compute the volatilityof the standard deviation of this portfolio P,by taking the square root of the variance that I just computed,this gives me 0.37%.So you could see that the variance dropped quite sharplyfrom 1.18% for a portfolio that had 30 stocks,to 0.37% for a portfolio that has 300 stocks.And so the key lesson here is that it's exactly this drop.In the limit we know that idiosyncratic volatilityof the portfolio, of equally weighted portfolio,is going to go to zero.You can see here that if I increase n1 to furtherto 3,000, again, maintaining the same assumption here,the volatility of this equally weighted portfoliois going to drop further to 0.12%.So if we continue increasing, it's going to go down,it's going to go down to 0.And this is the key lesson of this example.

PROFESSOR: In this question, we willlearn how to identify arbitrage opportunities.in the context of factor models.We will consider two factor models and threewell-diversified portfolios, A, B, and C with the followingcharacteristics.This table gives us expected returns and factor loadingson the first and second factor for the three portfolios.We'll construct an arbitrage strategy,such that generates $1,000 today and haszero payoff in the future.We will assume that there is a risk-free instrument.And the current risk-free rate is 1.5%.Let us start constructing our arbitrage strategy by assumingthat we buy or go long portfolios A, B,and C, as well as the risk-free bondsin the following amounts, XA, XB, XC, and Xrf.This will be the dollar amount thatwas spent on these securities.We will allow these amounts to be negative,which would indicate that we are shorting these securities.So this table summarizes our positions.So in the last column, I indicate the amountsthat we invest in each of these four securities.And at the bottom, I put the risk-free bond.And I put the expected return, which is 1.5%.And, of course, the factor exposureson both factors for the risk-free security are zeros.Recall that we want to construct a trading strategy thatgives us $1,000 today.So therefore, we can write down the following equation.So the money that we spend right nowon taking positions in these four securitiesshould equal to $1,000.So notice the negative signs on all X's here,because we assumed that we are buyingall of these four securities.Now, of course, we can immediatelysee that some of these X's have to be negative.In other words, we have to be shortingsome of these securities.Otherwise, there is no possibilitythat we would earn a positive $1,000.Now what does arbitrage mean in this particular context?Number one, it means that our expected returnsfrom our portfolio will be 0.Two, it means that we have no exposure to systematic risk.And three, since we are working withwell-diversified portfolios, which by construction haveno idiosyncratic risk, it means that we do not have exposureto idiosyncratic risk, because weare working with three well-diversified portfoliosand with a risk-free bond.So as long as all of these three conditions are satisfiedand the third one is satisfied by construction,so as long as the first two are satisfied,it means we will have arbitrage opportunity in this market.Let's start with the first condition, zero expectedreturn.The equation that is written here indicates that the futurevalue of our portfolio is $0.00, which means that we are earning0% expected return.The first part of this equation for exampleXA times 1 plus expected the return on portfolio A,this is just the future value of portfolio A. Similarly,XB is the dollar value that we invested in portfolioB, that is one plan plus expected return portfolio B,is the future value of this portfolioand so similarly for portfolio C and similarlyfor the risk-free bond.If we plug-in the numbers that were given in this question,so we know the expected returns on the three portfolios,and we know that the risk-free rate is 1.5%,this gives us this equation.So this is an equation with four unknowns-- soour X's, XA, XB, XC, and Xrf.Now the second arbitrage conditionis that we have no exposure to systematic risk.In this particular model, we have two systematic riskfactors, 1 and 2.And so this would mean that we have no exposureto both of these systematic risk factors.Technically speaking, it means that the factor loadingsof our portfolio on both of these factors should be 0.And so this is the first equation.So the factor loadings of the portfolio P on factor 1 is 0.We can expand and write this down,because the beta of the portfolio Pis the weighted average of the betas of the portfolios A, B,and C here.Recall that, of course, the beta of the risk-free bond is 0.So it is 0 here.With P in this equation, it's just the total valueof the portfolio.And so, therefore, we have this equation.So weighted average of the betas of well-diversified portfolioA, B, and C should equal to 0.We can see that the total value of portfolio VP cancels out.So it's irrelevant here.And so, therefore, we are left with the following equation.So beta 1 of portfolio A, which is 0.95 multiplied by XA,plus factor loading of portfolio B on the first factor, whichis 0.85 times XB plus the factor loading of portfolioC on the first factor 1.2 times XC.So this should equal to 0.Similarly, we can write down exactly the same equationfor the second risk factor.So this is the equation.So the only thing that changes here,the fact that all of these betas are the factor loadingsof portfolios A, B, and C on the second risk factor.And so plugging in the betas of each of these portfolios,we get this equation.We now can combine all of the equations into one system.We have a system of four equations and four unknowns.The first equation says that we're making $1,000 today.The second equation says that we have $0.00 and 0% expectedreturn.And the third and fourth equationsays that we have no systematic exposureto the first and second risk factor.Now, we already learned how to solvea system of linear equations in Excel, for example.Refer to recitation number four question 2.So repeating the same steps, we can solve thisand get the following answer.So XA is going to be equal to negative $235,480.XB would equal to $24,360.XC equals the $169,167.And Xrf equals to $40,953.This means that we are going short portfolio A.And we are buying portfolios B and Cand also buying the risk-free bond.So this effectively means that portfolio Ahad too low of an expected returngiven its systematic risk.And so, therefore, we're shorting that portfolio.And we're buying portfolios B and C. Importantly,this illustrates the fact that to avoid arbitrageopportunities in the market, expected returnson well-diversified portfolios, and their exposureto systematic risk should be consistent with one another.Otherwise, as it's illustrated here,there will be an arbitrage opportunity.And this condition that guaranteesno arbitrage in this market is whatgives us the APT pricing equation, whichis a very important result.

#### 415-1x_Rec 7_Q4-en

PROFESSOR: In this question, we willlearn how to find factor risk premia or factor risk prices.Let's consider the following three factor model.We are given four well-diversified portfolios--A, B, C, and D--with the following characteristics.So we are given the expected returns and factor loadingson all three factors.So now, given this information, in particular the returnsand factor loadings, the goal is to find factor riskpremia for all three factors.We can start with APT pricing equation that tells usthat the expected excess return on a portfolio pshould equal to the factor risk premia multipliedby their factor loadings.So for example, in our case, when we have three factormodel, it's the price of the first factorlambda 1 multiplied by the loading on this first factorof portfolio p, so beta p1.Plus the price of the second risk factormultiplied by the loading of this portfoliop on the second risk factor, plus the priceof the third risk factor times the loading.So we can write this down specifically for portfolio A.So in this case, it's going to be expected return portfolioA minus the risk-free rate, equals to, again,the prices of the factors multipliedby the risk exposure of this portfolio A to these factors.So more specifically, we can plug in the numbersthat we are given in this question.So for portfolio A, the expected return was 21.65%.And the factor loadings were 0.95 from the first factor,1.2 on the second, and 0.85 on the third.And now, what we can do, we can write downthe same exact equations for the remaining three portfolios.So here, we have four equations writtenfor each of the portfolios.And so these are the APT pricing equations.And so if we look at this carefully,we will see that we have four equations and four unknowns.Therefore, we can write down the following system of equations.We can write down the system of equationsin the following matrix form.And now, all we have to do is we haveto solve this equation for the three lambdas, which, again,the prices of the three corresponding risk factorsand the risk-free rate.So solving this equation gives us the following numbers.So the price of the first risk factor is 6.5%.The price of the second risk factor is 10%.The price of the third risk factor is 3.5%.And the risk-free rate here is 0.5%.And this is how you find factor riskpremia from known expected returns and factor loadings.Notice that, in this case, we have a three factor model,and we don't know risk-free rate.So therefore, we need expected the returns and factor loadingson at least four well-diversified portfoliosto find all the risk premia and the risk-free rate.If we were already given the risk-free rate,we only needed three well-diversified portfoliosto find factor risk premia.Now, finally, once we know the factor riskpremia and the risk-free rate in this economy,we can price all the other well-diversified portfoliosas long as we know their factor loadings.And knowing the factor loadings and the factor risk premia,we should be able to find their expected returns.

PROFESSOR: In this question, we will work with dataand we will learn how to implement arbitrage pricingtheory model in practice.We will consider a two factor modelthat has the market and the price of gold as the riskfactors.The price of gold can be a risk factor in its own.Or it can correlate with other risk factors.For example, inflation.To proxy for these two risk factors,we will use factor mimicking portfolios.For the market factor, we will use the returnson the market portfolio.And for the price of gold, we will use the returnson the Spider Gold Shares ETF.On your screen, you can see a snippetfrom the fact sheet of this ETF, which is tradedunder the ticker symbol GLD.We will implement this model by using returns on eight firms.Four of these firms up from the gold mining industry.And the other four are from the technology industry.These firms are listed on your screen.In this file, I have monthly return dataon each of these eight stocks.So for each of them, the sample covers January 2005 all the waythrough December 2019.So for each of these stocks, we have 15 yearsworth of monthly return data.So the return for a given month on each of the stocksis given in column C. The column next to it,column D contains the risk free rates.Column E contains the return on the market portfolio.And column F contains the returns on the GLD ETF.And all of this data is organized by firm.So this is the first firm, then I have the second firmand so forth.So I have eight of these blocks correspondingto each of the stocks.Now, recall that, to implement the APT modelin our particular case where we have two risk factors--the market and the price of gold--we have to run the following regression.So we have to regress the excess returnon the excess return on the market portfolioand the excess return on the gold ETF.And this regression has to include the constant, as well.So therefore, to run this regression,first I am computing excess return on each of the stocksby taking the return and subtracting the risk free rate.Next, I'm computing the excess market returnwhere I'm taking the return on the market portfolio.And again, subtracting the risk free rate.And then I'm doing the same thing for the GLD ETF.So I'm computing the excess return on this ETFby taking its return and subtracting the risk free rate.Now, we are ready to run this regression.There are several ways of running linear regressionin Excel.I'm going to be using a function that is called LINEST.So because this is a multiple regression,I will be estimating three coefficients.So the lowering on each of the two riskfactors and a constant.So the way I'm going to implement this functionis it's an array function.So I am highlighting these three cellsand I will write the following.So I'll say LINEST.And the first input into this functionwould be the left hand side variable,which is our excess return on the stock.So this column.And the next input will be the metrics of the right hand sidevariables, which would be these two.Then for constant and for statistics, I will say yes.Because I do want to have a constant estimated,because this is the way to run this regression.And then I will also say 1 for the loss parameter.And then recall that this is a rate function.So I have to hit Shift, Control, and Enter at the same time.Now, notice that the way this function works is itactually gives the estimate of the coefficientsfrom this regression as the lost number.And the first number is actually in the reverse order of the waythey appear in the matrix.So the first estimate is the estimate on gold.And the second is the estimate on the market.Now let's estimate this regressionfor the remaining firms.I'll show you how to estimate it for the next firm.And then, I will let you do the rest of the exercise yourself.So I'm, again, highlighting the three cells.I'm writing LINEST.I'm going down to the portion of the filewhere half the returns in the corresponding stock.So I'm highlighting my y's first.Next, I'm highlighting my x's.So it's these two columns.Then I'll say 1 and 1.And then I will hit Shift, Control, Enter.And you will see that this process estimatesthe coefficients again on gold market and the intercept.Now I have estimated all eight regressionsand these are the results.So these are the loadings on the gold factor for gold miningcompanies.And these are the loadings on the market factor.These are the loadings of the technologystocks and the gold factor.And these are the loadings of the technologystocks on the market factor.Next, let's average the factor loadings for gold mining stocksand for technology stocks.What I'm doing in this highlighted tableis I'm averaging the loadings of the gold stockson this first gold factor.And the second number here is the averageof the loadings on the market factor.Down below, this is the average of the loadings of the techstocks on the gold factor.And this is the average of their loadings on the market factor.Now, let's think and interpret these results.First, notice that the loading of gold miningstocks on the gold risk factor is large and positive.This should make economic sense because, when the price of goldgoes up, presumably these companiescan generate higher revenue.And, therefore, investors reward these firmswith higher returns.For technology stocks, this loadingis negative, which means that, when the prices of goldgo down, on average the returns on technology stocksgo up and vice versa.The loading of the technology stocks on the market riskfactor is close to 1, which meansthat, if the stock market goes up by 1%, on averagethe technology stocks go up by 1%, as well.And the loading of gold mining stocks on the market riskfactor is around 0.2, which meansthat they have much lower sensitivity of their returnswith respect to the market risk factor.

PROFESSOR: Let's use our estimated APT modelto forecast future expected returns.Let's assume that the returns on those stockssatisfy the exact two factor APT modelwith the stock market and the gold ETF as the two factors.Let's also assume that the estimated factor loadingsare exact.Suppose that we are given a forecastfor the expected excess monthly returns going forwardfor the market of 0.75% and for the gold 0.15%.Let's use the average factor loadings we've computedand compute the expected excess returnfor the technology sector and for the gold mining sector.To compute the expected returns on both of these sectors,we need to take the factor risk premiaand multiply them by the loadingsthat these two sectors have on the corresponding risk factors.So let's start with the expected return on the technologysector.It will be equal the expected excess returnon the market multiplied by the loadingsthat technology sector has on the market,which is 0.98, plus the expected excess return on gold,which is 0.15%.This is the number given to us.Multiplied by the loadings that the technology sectorhas on the gold risk factor, which is negative 0.17.And this would be our expected returnon the technology sector.Similarly, for the gold mining sector,we have the expected excess return on the market multipliedby the loadings that the mining sector has on the market,which is 0.19, plus the expected excess returnon the gold multiplied by the loadingsthat the gold sector has on the gold, which is 1.75.And the result would be 0.4%.To summarize, given the forecast of the expected excess monthlyreturns on the market and gold, 0.75% and 0.15%,the expected return of the technology sectormonthly return would be 0.71 and the expected monthly returnin the gold mining sector would be 0.4%.

PROFESSOR: This week, we talk about market efficiency.Market efficiency is a very important topic,which is somewhat subtle.Part of the challenge is that the notion of efficiencyis broadly used, and it has different meaningsin different contexts.In our discussion, in finance, efficiencyhas a very particular, precise meaning,which we are going to clarify.The general notion of economic efficiencyhas to do with the allocation of limited resources.Are resources used in the most productive manner possible?It is certainly an important question.And a well-functioning financial systemplays a critical role in the allocation of resources.This is not, however, how we think about efficiencyin financial markets.Financial market efficiency is about how well market pricesaggregate information.In an efficient market, prices fullyreflect all available information.What we're going to do is clarifywhat exactly it means for prices to fully reflect information.We will also look at empirical evidence in favoror against the efficient markets hypothesis.Why would we expect markets to be efficient?The answer is, ultimately, because of arbitrage.Financial markets are fiercely competitive.Traders, by chasing profitable trading opportunities,incorporate all useful information into prices.As a result, prices fully reflectall the relevant available information.A common criticism that you would hearis that, how can markets be efficientwhen investors are human and humans make mistakes?That is certainly true.However, this criticism is misplaced.Market efficiency does not requiremost of the traders or investors to berational and well-informed.What we need is just a few smart, well-financed agentswho are unconstrained, and they arethe ones who can spot and eliminate profitable tradingopportunities.They eliminate inefficiencies.In other words, market efficiencyis a theory of sharks who capture profitable tradingopportunities.It is not a theory of how an average investor behaves.

PROFESSOR: We will now discuss a particular examplethat illustrates the notion of market efficiency very well.This is the Challenger crash.It happened in January of 1986.On the 28th of January at 11:39 AM,the Space Shuttle Challenger exploded.It was 73 seconds into its flight.Immediately, news outlets reported the event.Space Shuttle explodes, various contractorswho contributed to parts of the shuttle were asked to comment.They had no immediate comment.A presidential commission was formedto investigate the causes of the crash.Famously, Richard Feynman, a well-known physicistof the day, was on the commission.The commission eventually concluded several months laterthat the cause of the crash was the infamous O-ring.In the report published on June 9th of 1986,the commission found that this rubbery piece of insulationfailed due to low temperatures, whichled to fuel leak and, ultimately, the explosion.Let's take a look at the action in the financial marketson the day of the crash.We are now taking a close minute-by-minute lookat the price behavior.What you see on the graph is a time seriesof prices on several companies, whichwere the important contractors contributingelements of the shuttle.In the first few minutes immediatelyfollowing the crash, all of these prices collapsed.At that point, the market did notknow which of the contractors was responsible.But it was clear that someone will be at faultand the news was bad.A couple hours later, we see divergence.All of the prices except for one start recovering.But one of the stocks does not recover by the end of the day.This stock is the stock of Morton Thiokol, whichwas the producer of the O-ring.How did the market know, almost immediately,who was at fault when it took several monthsfor the presidential commission to figure it out?The answer is that some of the engineers at Morton Thiokolknew that there was a potential problem with their O-ring.They tried to warn NASA about the danger,but they were ignored, or overruled.The lesson here is that information that is availableto just a few can get impacted into prices relatively quickly.This is how markets reach efficiency.They're very good at aggregating useful pieces of information.

#### 415-1x_Lec_8-3_05-en

PROFESSOR: We now need to introduce a testable definitionof what it means for prices to fully reflectall available information.According to our definition, a marketis efficient if it is impossible to makeexcess profits by trading on all available information.Formally what that means is that the expected valueof the price plus the dividend next periodconditional on all available information,which we denote by the information set J sub t,is equal to the current price times the conditional expectedreturn on the asset.The exact form of market efficiencydepends on what exactly we include into the informationset.What do we mean by all available information?This is captured by J.There are three important cases of market efficiency,three forms.The weak form specifies that all available informationmeans all of the information included in the past historyof security prices.For example, if the market is weak-form efficient,it means that technical analysis,which looks at the past history of prices,cannot be used to achieve excess returns.The next level of market efficiencyis what is called the semi-strong-form efficiency.Under this notion, security pricesreflect all publicly available information.This is not just information on prices,but also information from other public sources.Under the semi-strong form of market efficiency,fundamental analysis that looks at various kindsof fundamental data does not allow oneto achieve excess returns.Finally, we get to the strong form of market efficiency.As the name suggests, this is the strongest notion.And according to the strong form,all information is reflected in prices,both public and private.Under this hypothesis, inside informationavailable to the firm insiders does notallow them to achieve superior performance or excess returns.When we test the efficient market hypothesis empirically,it is critical to differentiate excess or abnormal profitsfrom the risk premium.This means that to make the efficient market hypothesisusable, we need to take a stand on a particular risk model.We need to identify what is the risk premium justifiedby the risk exposures of the assetsand what part of their excess returnsis abnormal, which would be a violationof the efficient markets hypothesis.There are two common approaches of dealing with this challenge.We could use a common set of risk modelsto perform a risk adjustment and to identifywhat part of returns is abnormal on a risk-adjusted basis.The difficulty is that we do not have a well-accepted common setof risk models.And therefore, there is always a lingering doubtthat what we are seeing is not an abnormal performance,but rather a failure to find the right risk model.The second approach would be to find a profitable tradingstrategy that would be very difficult to justifyby any risk model.And we are going to look at some of the examplesof such strategies.Obviously, testing the efficient market hypothesislooks at the composite hypothesis,the markets are efficient, and that our risk adjustmentis correct.We're going to keep this in mind whenwe examine empirical evidence.

We now examine the weak form of the Efficient MarketsHypothesis.Empirical tests of the weak form lookat various patterns in returns, patterns,such as serial correlation in returns or performanceof filter rules or performance of technical analysis.Let's begin with the serial correlation.If past prices could be used to predict future returns,we would be able to detect a correlation between pricechanges and success of future returns.In other words, we would be able to seestatistical correlation between past returnsand future returns.This is known as serial correlation.Would high degree of serial correlationbe inconsistent with the efficient markets hypothesis?Or could it be explained by a risk model?The challenge when trying to explain serial correlationwith the risk model is that one wouldneed to argue that the conditional risk of an assetchanges rapidly over time in relation to past returns.Most common risk models do not havethat property, at least not at the high frequency,such as daily.In the following graph, we see an illustration.We look at daily returns on two stocks.One is Philips Electronics.The other one is Sony.These are both scatter plots.On the horizontal axis, we plot daily returns on day Tand on the vertical axis daily returnson the consecutive trading day, t plus 1.Both of these scatter plots reveal no obvious pattern.They look like a ball of points.This is the point here.There is no pattern of serial correlationin the daily returns of these stocks.As we estimate the serial correlation statistically,we see that it is very close and indistinguishable from 0.This type of pattern is typical.For most individual stocks, serial correlation of returnsis very close to 0.In a well-known study in 1965, Eugene Famaanalyzed patterns of serial correlationacross various stocks.And he found that the horizons of 1, 4, 9,16 days, evidence for serial correlationis essentially absent.On average, serial correlation among consecutive stock returnsis very close to 0 across stocks.The same can be said about index returns, or portfolio returns.The following graph illustrates lack of serial correlationfor the S&P 500 Index.Looking at the 10-year daily sample,we see that the relation between daily returnson consecutive trading days reveals no obvious patternof serial correlation.There are other statistical patterns that one can explore,which are related to the weak form of market efficiency.Two famous results are on momentum and reversalin returns.In a 1993 paper, Jegadeesh and Titmandocumented presence of medium-horizon momentumin asset returns.What they did is they sorted stocks on their past returnsover, say, a 6-month interval and thendocumented the average performanceover the following 6-month period.They found that the past winners tend to outperform overthe following period.The past losers tend to underperform.This phenomenon is known as momentum.Strong returns tend to continue, and weak returnstend to continue at certain horizons of several months.Hong, Lim, and Stein found that momentumis particularly strong among small stocks with low analystcoverage.A different pattern, called long-term reversal,was documented by De Bondt and Thaler in a 1985 paper.They found evidence that losers over longer horizons,let's say 36 months, subsequentlyoutperform over the horizon of 36 months.It's the opposite for the winners.Past winners tend to underperform overa similar horizon.The following graph shows some empirical evidencefor the historical performance of the past winnersversus past losers.What we see is a clear differencein the average returns.The winner portfolio outperformingthe loser portfolio.As we look at the historical performance of the momentumand the reversal strategies, the question that arisesis, do these pose a challenge to the weak formof efficient markets hypothesis?Can we explain differences in performancebetween winners and losers by differences in risk?This is a subject of an ongoing debate.For example, is it the case that the past winners are morerisky than the past losers?Is it the case that the long-term losersin the reversal strategy become more risky as a result?When we compute abnormal returns,we need to know what the normal returns are, returnsjustified by the risk exposure.Part of the challenge with the momentum strategy in particularis that membership in the winner and loser portfolios changesover time.Past winners don't stay in the winner portfolio for long.The same is true for the past losers.This means that if we wanted to explain momentumbased on risk exposures, we wouldhave to argue that the risk of stockschanges at relatively high frequency over time.Momentum strategies are also fairly well known.And they are commonly used by investment managers.The fact that their profitability does nottend to disappear over time suggeststhat these returns may not be purely abnormaland may indicate some kind of risk exposure.And that is the reason why they don't get arbitraged away.

PROFESSOR: We now consider the semi-strong formof market efficiency.Under the semi-strong form of efficiency,all public information should be fully reflected in prices,and it should be impossible to achieveabnormal risk adjusted returns by tradingon public information.This implies in particular that fundamental analysis should notbe useful for achieving abnormal investment performance.Now, the purpose of fundamental analysisis to exploit opportunities when some public informationabout firms is not reflected in prices immediately.If markets are semi-strong-form efficient,fundamental analysis is not going to achieve that goal.Information included under the semi-strong form of marketefficiency is going to contain things like firmfinancial statements, any types of corporate announcements,such as news about earnings, dividends, share repurchases,debt issue, stock splits, and so forth,as well as mergers, acquisitions, and takeovers.None of these types of announcements,none of these sources of public information,should be useful for generating abnormal investmentperformance.Let's examine how prices should respond to informationunder the semi-strong form of market efficiency.When the news arrives, there are three possible patterns.The price may react to the news immediatelywith no further adjustment.This is the blue line on the graph.We may see delayed reaction, which is the dotted line, sothat information gets priced in eventually,but not immediately.Or we may see overreaction, where the price movestoo much in response to an information release,and then it recovers back to the appropriate level.Under the semi-strong form of market efficiency,price action to news should be immediate.And we should not see any underreaction or overreaction.There should be no predictability in returnsfollowing the announcement.In other words, the blue line in the graphrepresents the average pattern of price response to the news.As we examine empirical evidence,we are going to look for evidence in favoror against this type of price response to information.An important tool used to analyzesemi-strong form of market efficiency is event studies.The objective of event studies isto examine if for specific information is incorporatedinto the price in a single jump once information is released.Let's discuss the design of the eventstudies, which is a commonly used statistical setting.And it's applied broadly, not justfor the purposes of analyzing market efficiency.The idea is to pull together various observationsand to connect them in time, so that day zerocorresponds to the date at which information is released.The actual events, of course, aregoing to occur to various firms at different pointsin physical time.We then calculate daily returns during a window,let's say a 30-days window, around the announcement date,around day zero.We'll look 30 days prior to the announcement and 30 daysfollowing the announcement.We then define the comparison group.For example, we could look at the market portfolioor the industry portfolio or a portfolio of similar firmsas a comparison group.And we compute returns on the comparison groupon the same days.We denote the return on the marketor a different kind of comparison groupas Rm sub t for each day t.Next, we define the abnormal return.The abnormal return is the differencebetween the return on the stock on day tand the return on its comparison group,which is supposed to have the same risk profile.The abnormal return AR on stock i at day tis the difference R sub it minus Rmt.In other words, it's the return of the stockminus the benchmark or the comparison group return.Once we define the abnormal daily returns on the stock,we calculate the average abnormal returnover all of the events.This is defined for each day in our window, 30 days priorto the announcement to 30 days following the announcement.Finally, we define the cumulative abnormal return,starting from 30 days prior to the announcement and allthe way to the end of the window, 30 days afterwards.And the cumulative abnormal returnis computed by simply adding up abnormal returnson consecutive days.This cumulative abnormal return is our object of analysis.Under the semi-strong form of market efficiency,we should not see on average a positive cumulative abnormalreturn.If you look at the following graph,we see, again, an illustration of howthe cumulative average abnormal return shouldlook under the efficient reactionto information, on the underreaction and overreaction.Following the efficient reaction to information,we should see an immediate jump on announcement, on day zero,with no clear pattern up or down following the announcement.If on the other hand, the market underreacts to information,we should see that the immediate response is relatively muted,and there is a pattern of predictabilitywith the upward drift in prices following the announcement.If the market overreacts, we are goingto see a very large immediate responseand then mean reversion afterwards.It is clear that under the efficient reactionto information, we will not be able to generateabnormal profits by trading on public informationafter the announcement.If the market under or over reacts to information,then such strategies will be possible.If the market underreacts, buyingfollowing the announcement shouldlead to abnormal profits.If the market overreacts, we wantto sell following the announcement.And that, again, would lead to abnormal profits.

PROFESSOR: Let's examine some empirical evidenceusing the events study tool.We're going to look at a couple of different typesof corporate announcements.One is the takeover announcement.When the firm becomes a target of takeover,it receives a takeover offer, which is typicallyat a significant premium to the current price of the firm.Following the takeover announcement,the price of the target firm jumps, but not all the wayto the offer price.This does not necessarily create a profitable tradingopportunity.The reason for that is that followingthe news of the takeover offer, thereis still significant uncertainty aboutwhether or not the takeover is going to go through.The question we want to address iswhether it is possible to generate abnormal tradingprofits by buying the stock of the target firm followingthe takeover news.As we see in the following graph, whenwe look at all of the firms followingthe announcement of the takeover offer,there is no obvious pattern in the stock price behaviorfollowing the announcement.The stock price jumps on the newsand remains flat on average over a 60-day period followingthe announcement.If we then look at all of the firms for which the takeovereventually materializes, their pricetends to move higher over the 60-day window.Of course, we cannot monetize this type of pattern,because we don't know in advance which of the firms are goingto eventually complete the takeover.If we look at the firms for which takeover does notgo through, the price of these firmsreverts to the pre-offer level.Again, this is looking at the datawith the benefit of hindsight.We don't know at day zero, which of the firmsare going to end up on the blue or the yellow lines.What we see instead is the average patternacross all of the firms.And when we look across all of the firms,there is no predictable price reactionfollowing the announcement.In other words, markets seem to respondto the information about a takeover offerin an efficient manner, as predictedby the efficient markets hypothesis.The response is immediate.And there is no subsequent price drift.Another type of news that we examine using a similar designis the announcement of dividend omissions.Typically, when the firm decides to omit a dividend,that is perceived by the market as a piece of bad news.Firms are highly reluctant to cut or omit dividends.And they only do this when their business circumstances requireso.In other words, the news of a dividend omissionis a bad news about the future prospects of the firm.And in particular, it's a negative signalabout future cash flows.What we see empirically is that the pricetends to drop on the announcement of the dividendomission, which reflects the fact that thisis a piece of negative news about the future cashflows of the firm.And there is no clear pattern of price drift up or downfollowing the announcement.Again, what we see is that price behavior around dividendomissions is consistent with the semi-strong form of marketefficiency.Price response to the announcement immediately,and there is no room for achieving abnormal tradingprofits by trading following the announcement.Next, we'll look at the pattern, whichis known as the post-earnings announcement drift.Our discussion is based on the paper by Bernard and Thomasfrom 1989 that looked at the price behavior followingearnings announcements.This pattern poses a bit of a challengeto the semi-strong form of market efficiency.If we sold stocks into portfoliosbased on the magnitude of the surprise in their earningsannouncements-- in other words, if welook at earnings announcements in relationto analyst expectations, we find that the stocks for whichearnings announcements deliver the largest positive surpriserelative to expectations tend to jump on announcement,which is what we would expect.But then what is puzzling is that theycontinue rising in value following the announcement.If we look at the other side, if welook at the stocks with the negative surprise,we see the reverse pattern.They fall in value on announcementand then continue declining afterwards.This pattern is puzzling.And it is similar to the momentum pattern.Companies that perform well during a recent windowcontinue performing abnormally well going forward.And firms that perform relatively poorly,looking back, continue underperforming going forward.To explain this pattern using a risk-based model,we would need to argue that the firms thatdeliver a positive earnings surprisehave a relatively high level of risk going forward.And this is what explains their relatively high performance.The firms that have a negative earnings surprisewould need to have a relatively low level of risk, whichwould explain why the average returns going forwardare relatively low.It is fairly challenging to come upwith a plausible risk-based explanationfor the post-earnings announcement drift.It is fair to say that there is no consensus on whether or notthis pattern is an anomaly or evidence of time varying riskexposures of the firms.

PROFESSOR: The challenge in testing the semi-strong formof market efficiency is that we can onlyhope to find evidence against the hypothesis.To do that, we would have to find a trading strategy usingpublic information that achieves abnormal returns.We cannot examine all possible trading strategies of thistype.Therefore, there is always this lingering doubtthat perhaps we simply didn't lookat the right types of trading strategies,and that is why we haven't identified abnormal returns.There is an alternative strategy for testing the hypothesis.Instead of looking for particular trading strategies,particular types of public information to predict returns,we're going to look instead at asset managementand ask whether or not active asset managers areable to achieve abnormal returns.The idea here is simple.Active asset managers use fundamental analysis.They use public information to try and achieveabnormal performance relative to their risk-adjusted,risk-matched benchmarks.We're going to look for abnormal performance of such managers.And if they are able to beat their benchmarkson a risk-adjusted basis, we're goingto conclude that there is evidencethat some types of public informationis useful for generating abnormal performance.We wouldn't know exactly which signalsthese managers are using.But we are going to see that somehow they'reable to use public information to achieve abnormal returns.If, on the other hand, active managers are notable to outperform on a risk-adjusted basis,we're going to conclude that all sorts of public informationthat these managers may be looking atare not useful for achieving abnormal performance.This is the idea.Instead of looking for signals based on public informationourselves, we're going to examine performanceof the active asset managers and seeif they are able to use public information to achieveabnormal investment performance.We're going to look at the active equity fundsand compare their performance to equity indices.This is a somewhat crude way of adjusting for riskby comparing a return on the mutual fundto the broad market return.We find that on average mutual fundstend to underperform the market about 60%, 70% of the time.One may argue that perhaps the appropriate way of doing a riskadjustment is not to simply subtract the marketreturn from the fund return, but to estimate the riskexposure of the fund and to risk adjust each fund basedon their particular risk exposure, which may notbe equivalent to the risk in the index.This type of refinement does not change the conclusion.The majority of the funds does not deliver abnormal returnson the risk-adjusted basis.This type of risk adjustment alsoincludes adjustment for expenses, asset managementfees.Any type of abnormal performance that the managers maybe able to achieve by using public informationis erased by expenses.At the end of the day, the professional investmentmanagement doesn't seem to generate value for investors.And any type of value added they seemto be able to produce using public informationaccrues to the managers themselvesand not to the investors.The following table summarizes historical performanceof all equity funds grouped along a number of dimensions.We can see that when we look across all domestic equityfunds or when we group them by style, by size,and so forth, the pattern is very similar.The majority of the funds underperforms their benchmarks,particularly over longer periods of time.The advantage of this type of analysisis that instead of comparing all of the fundsto the broad market, we are comparing them to the benchmarkthat the funds themselves state as relevantfor their investment style.The hope is that this kind of comparisoncaptures their risk exposure of the funds relative closely.Another way of looking at the evidenceis to ask whether there is any wayto predict which funds may outperform their benchmarksor the market going forward.Perhaps on average, funds do not deliver abnormal performance.But could it be that some of them are able to do so?And if we simply focus on the best funds,we will see evidence of abnormal investment performance usingpublic information?It turns out that it is very difficultto identify or predict which managers are goingto outperform going forward.In the following table, you see one type of analysisthat provides evidence of the lack of predictabilityin investment performance.This is a very simple approach.We sort funds on their past performanceinto five quintiles from the 20% of the worst performersto the 20% of the best performersand then examine how these funds do going forward.What we see is that past performance does notpredict which funds will end up as future winners,specifically which funds will be in the top quintileby investment performance.The only pattern we see is that poorly performing funds,the funds in the bottom quintile of past performance,are likely to perform somewhat poorly going forward.And they're also more likely to end up closedor to merge with another fund.Because these mutual funds cannot be shorted,such pattern of predictable poor performance cannot be usedby investors to generate abnormal positive returns.One may argue that the reason why we do not see a patternof predictability in returns, why we cannot identifythe winner funds, the best managers,is because our method of analysis is relatively crude.Perhaps sorting funds on their past performanceis not the best way to find the best managers,and there is a more sophisticated approachthat could reveal funds with a relatively highpositive abnormal performance.One idea for addressing this type of challengeis to look at the professional pension fund managers.Instead of looking for the winning mutual fund managersourselves, we're going to look at the performanceof the pension fund managers, whotry to identify the best mutual fund managers for managingtheir assets.Our discussion is based on the academic studies thatlooked at the sample of pension fund managersfrom 1994 to 2003 period and examined their hiring decisionsfor mutual fund managers.In the sample, we see over 8,000 hiring decisionsof 3,400 plan sponsors.These are pension funds that allocate their capitalto professional money managers.What we observe is that prior to the hiring decision,performance of the fund managers is relatively good.They outperform their benchmarks on the risk-adjusted basisby several percentage points.This is not surprising, because plan sponsorsuse past performance of the fund as an inputinto their decision.What we see after the hiring processis that going forward these managerstend to outperform their benchmark by approximately64 basis points.This is on the value weighted basis.This amount of outperformance is consistentwith the typical level of management feesthat these funds charge.In other words, following the hiring decision,these managers do not deliver abnormal performanceafter fees.Any kind of outperformance they seem to be able to generateis then consumed by the fees that theycharge to the plan sponsor.In conclusion, what we see is that it is noteasy to find trading signals basedon the public information that would allowus to forecast future returns.While academic literature contains some examplesof the signals that seem to forecast returns,one has to be careful interpretingthis kind of evidence.It seems that while it may be possible to findsuch signals in historical analysis,we do not see evidence of abnormal live performanceof the professional managers.The challenge of going from their academic resultsfrom the back tests looking for abnormal patterns in returnsto the actual investment strategiesis that when we implement trading strategies,we have to deal with a variety of frictionsthat eat into performance--trading costs, market impact, constraints,and so forth, as well as various statistical biases.At the end of the day, any evidencethat we may find by analyzing historical datadoesn't seem to translate into actual investmentperformance of professional active managers.

PROFESSOR: We now examine the strong formof market efficiency.This is the most extreme form of the hypothesis.And it states that no informationcan be used to achieve abnormal investment performance, noteven private information.Most academics and practitioners believethat this strong form of market hypothesisdoes not hold in the data.Markets are not strong-form efficient.Private information could be usedto achieve abnormal returns.We're going to look at some academic studies thatexamine performance of insiders and findevidence of superior returns based on private information.We should know that in most developed countries,trading on insider information is illegal.In the US, legislation from 1934,the Act of the US Securities and Exchange Commission,rules against insider trading.Trading by firm insiders based on private or privilegedinformation is prohibited.There are also constraints on the investment banksthat separate investment banking from salesand trading and research for the same purpose.It is well understood that tradingon private or inside information is toxic to the market.It erodes market liquidity.And therefore, various legal safeguardsare put in place to limit this type of activity.We do not rely on the markets to fully reflectinside information in prices.The following table, based on a 1992 studyin the Journal of Finance, examinesperformance of insider traders.The data here comes from the criminal caseswhere insider trading has been documented.And therefore, we know exactly wheninsiders were trading on privileged information, whattypes of announcements they were using,and what kind of performance they were able to achieve.The most common example is tradingon the takeover-related information.What we see is that abnormal performance of insidersis highly economically significant and statisticallysignificant.Average cumulative of normal returnfollowing a takeover-related news is close to 30%.This is also confirmed what most academics and practitionersbelieve, that trading on inside information can be profitableand that markets are not strong-form efficient.This is the reason why insider trading is heavily regulated,and various legal restrictions areplaced trying to prevent this type of activityin financial markets.Another way of looking at insider trading,rather than examining individual cases,is to look at the average price behavioraround the announcements.The following study from 1981 looksat the price behavior and tradingvolume around the takeover announcements.What we see here is intriguing.Following the announcement, on average,there is no price drift up or down,which would seem to be consistent with the semi-strongform of market efficiency.What is puzzling here is that prior to the announcement,there seems to be a clear pattern in the price behavior.The price of the target stock tendsto rise in the days preceding the news.It is difficult to explain this kind of patternother than by appealing to the factthat some of the traders with privileged informationare trading before the news, and their tradesare getting impacted into prices.And they're moving the price of the target firm.On average, roughly half of the price increasethat occurs as a result of a takeover announcementhappens in the days preceding the announcement, whichis strong evidence for some kind of insider trading aheadof the announcement.We might not know who exactly is trading aheadof the announcement.These are not the firm insiders whowould have to file a note with the SEC following their trades,revealing their trading activity.But it does appear that some third partieswith the sensitive information about the takeoverare trading ahead of the announcement.

PROFESSOR: We now looked at various types of informationrelated to the weak, semi-strong,and the strong form of market efficiency.The conclusion is that markets appearto be fairly efficient in a weak sense.It is difficult to achieve abnormal performanceusing historical information on prices.Markets also pretty close to beingsemi-strong form efficient.It is hard to achieve abnormal performancebased on public information.But there is evidence that private, inside informationcould be used to achieve abnormal performance.Let's discuss a few questions related to these observations.One central question is, how exactly does informationget into prices?Our example of the Challenger crash gives us a clue.Prices reflect information because various tradersact on the information that they have.Markets don't happen to be efficient on their own.They become efficient as a result of the trading activity,as a result of various market participantspursuing profitable trading opportunities.By doing that, they help make prices efficient.They impound the information into the prices.Having said that, if prices end upreflecting all available information,who has the incentive to collect information in the first placeif information gathering is costly?This creates a bit of a paradox.In order for the markets to be informational efficient,someone needs to collect information and trade on it.Yet, if markets are as efficient as we say,there is no incentive to collect information and curb the cost.This suggests a relatively nuanced viewof market efficiency.Markets don't happen to be perfectly efficient.What we see is a process by which marketsare moving towards efficiency.This process, however, relies on a constant informationgathering and trading by market participants.They need to be incentivized to do that, which means that therehas to be some room for achieving profitable investmentperformance by investing information, gathering,and processing.What has to be the case, however,is that after accounting for the costs of gathering information,there is no remaining room for abnormal performanceas a result of intense competitionbetween various traders.In other words, one cannot expect to achieve abnormalperformance for free by looking at the easily available piecesof information.There may, however, be room for beating benchmarks,beating indices on a risk adjusted basisby the amount that reflects the amount of resources expendedon collecting and processing information.A few practical issues about the efficient markets hypothesisremain.One is misidentification.Perhaps the reason why we see some evidenceof abnormal performance is that we have missing risk factors.Our risk adjustment is not perfect.The possibility that some risk factorsare missing from our risk model is always present.And this is something that we haveto keep in mind when we examine evidence on performanceof various trading strategies.A related issue is time variationin risk loadings and risk premia.As we identify normal and abnormal returns,we have to keep in mind that risk and riskpremium may be time varying.And using risk models with constant risk premiawith constant risk loadings can leadto misidentification of what we callnormal or risk-based returns.There is a host of other issues that we can broadly describeas market imperfections.When we examine performance of trading strategies usinghistorical back tests, we have to worryabout frictions like transaction costs, liquidity, taxes,price impact, and so forth.In other words, when we look at the historical performanceof trading strategies on paper, wehave to keep in mind that these may nottranslate one-to-one to the actual investment performancein real market scenarios.Finally, we want to address the issue of microversus macro efficiency.Our argument for market efficiencyhas to do with absence of arbitrage.It has to do with the fact that in a competitive market,investors pursue profitable trading opportunities,and they eliminate mispricing as a result.This argument works best at the micro level.When we compare one stock to another with similar riskexposures, or one derivative security to anotheror to the underlying asset, we can expect arbitrage activityto eliminate mispricing.This argument is a lot harder to makeat the level of broad asset classes, at the macro level.As a result, market efficiency as a concepthas most clear implications for the micro efficiency,for the relative pricing of individual assets.It is a lot harder to think about abnormal performanceat the level of broad asset classes,like equities and bonds, real estate, and so forth.The main lessons from the efficient market hypothesisare the following.We contrast market prices.When we buy and sell financial assets at the market prices,we achieve zero net present value.Market prices are fair.We neither make abnormal returns,nor do we lose money when we trade at market prices.This has important implications in corporate financein capital budgeting.Market efficiency implies that market prices provide the bestestimate of the economic value of projects,and that we should use the net present value, the marketvalue of the investment projects, as our guidefor investment decisions.Firms should also expect to gain fair value for the securitiesthat they issue.When they finance projects by issuing debt and equity,they would expect investors to pay the fair pricebecause, on average, assets that trade in the financial marketare neither overvalued or undervalued.Market efficiency also means that we can read into prices.You could use financial prices to extract informationabout fundamentals.And this is something that can bedefinitely useful for forecastingand economic policy.Another lesson from market efficiencyis that there are no financial illusions.Market prices reflect fundamental informationproperly.This means that the market value of the firm,the market the value of an asset, is based on its payoff.It is not easy to trick the market, for instance,by playing with accounting data.The last conclusion, the last lesson from market efficiency,is that one needs to have some kind of economic edgein order to generate a positive NPV.Otherwise, if you trade in the financial markets,every transaction is a fair transaction.It has zero net present value.In order to create the project whichadds value, which has a positive net present value,we need to either have superior information,or superior technology, or accessto cheap resources, some kind of competitive advantageor economic edge that translates into a positive net presentvalue.We cannot simply add value by buying and selling financialsecurities.

PROFESSOR: In this example, we will conduct an event studyfor dividend announcements.Consider the following for stocks.The first stock on December 13, 1996 declared a dividendof $0.10 per share.Notice that the previous dividend they omitted.The second stock on November 4, 2003declared an increase in dividend from $0.06 per sharethe quarter before to $0.12 per share.The third company on December 18, 2013declared a special dividend of $0.41 per share.And finally, the last company on February 19, 2015initiated a dividend of $0.05 per share.Here we have the other returns on these four stocksaround the time they made these dividends announcements.For each of the stocks, I highlighted the dateswhen they made the corresponding announcementin this orange color.So this is first stock, for second stock, for third stock.This is for the fourth stock.We have returns on the stocks in column I.We also have the returns on the marketson the same dates in column J.First, let me compute the abnormal return, whichI will define as the difference between the return on the stockminus the market return.And I will call this column AR, whichstands for the abnormal return.So this is the return on the stock in excess of the market.Next, let us compute the average abnormal returnacross these four stocks on the announcement date.So what I will do is I will say averageof the abnormal returns for each of the stockson the announcement date.So these two numbers, this is on the third stock.And this is on the fourth stock.And so let's see what we get.So on average, the announcement at the return was 3.5%.So clearly, the market interpretsthis at the initiations or specialor increases in dividends as positive news.Now, what I want to do next is I willcompute the same average abnormal returns on the daysaround this announcement.And let's see what we get.So I will go 10 days before the announcement.And I will also go down to 10 days after the announcement.And I will extend just this number up and down.And because everything here is symmetric in the file,it's going to compute the average of the returns,for example.This would be the average of the returns on the daybefore the announcement for these four stocks.From this table, we could see that the returnon the announcement date itself is the highest.Let us accumulate these returns and thenplot them to visually see how the market processesthis information.So in this next column, I will computecumulative average of normal returns by doing the following.For each day, we will add up returnsfrom day minus 10 all the way to this day, for example.For day minus 8, we will add up the returns from minus 10all the way to minus 8.And so for us to effectively do it,let's fix the top of this array so that we can simplystretch this.And then this would automaticallycompute all of the returns all the way to the plus 10.Now, I have plotted the cumulative average abnormalreturn.And this is how the chart looks like.So we can clearly see that on the announcement date, day 0,there is a strong positive return, again,which is probably consistent with the factthat this announcement of dividend increasesor special dividends on average interpreted as good newsfor the future of these firms.Importantly, we also do not see price driftis tied in the positive or negative direction followingthe announcement.Therefore, this evidence is consistentwith semi-strong form market efficiency hypothesis, whichsays that the prices react to information immediately,and there is no way for us to earn abnormal trading profitsfollowing the announcement.

PROFESSOR: We now apply the principles and toolswe have developed to corporate financial decisions.As we have discussed earlier, corporate decisionslead to changes on both the assetand liability side of the balance sheet.We consider them in turn.Changes to the asset side come primarilyfrom the firm's real investments.These investment decisions are alsoreferred to as capital budgeting-- that is,what projects to invest in.The nature of these projects is verygeneral, ranging from expanding existing business to mergersand acquisitions to a marketing plan or an IT upgradeto new business lines, you name it.These projects will all add new assetsto the firm, which lead to future cash rolls or earnings.Changes to the liability side are relatedto several financial decisions.The first is the financing decision,namely how the firm finances its business or assets.A firm does so by selling financial assets or claims,such as taking a bank loan, issuing debt, stockin other corporate securities.The second financial decision is payout--that is, what to pay to the firm's shareholders.This includes when and how much the firm pays its dividendsor buy back its shares.Since payout is primarily about servicing the stockholders,it can also be viewed as part of financing.The third financial decision is risk management.Naturally, the firm's business or assetsare exposed to a range of risks.Some are systematic, and some arenon-systematic or idiosyncratic.What should the firm do with these risks?With a rich array of financial contracts traded in a market,the firm can easily use them to adjust its risk exposures.Two important questions arise.First, what risk should the firm keep,and what risk should the firm unload in the market?Second, how can the firm achieve a risk management goalafter setting one?Using the balance sheet of the firm,we can easily capture these decisions.The asset side reflects the firm's real investments--in particular, the fixed assets.The liability side reflects the firm's financing, payout,and risk management situations.As an illustration, let us consider a concrete example.What is shown on the slide is the balance sheetof Amazon in 1996 and 1997.The numbers are in thousand dollars.In 1996, Amazon's total assets are worth roughly $8.2 million.Most of them are in cash and securities, about $6.2 million.Fixed assets are about $1.1 million.The remaining are inventories and prepaid expenses.On the liability side, Amazon has $2.8 millionin accounts payable and $2.0 million in accrued expenses.It had no debt.The equity is $3.4 million.The total liability amounts to $8.2 million,the same as the total asset.In 1997, Amazon's balance sheet has changed a lot,increased by about 18 times.The total assets are now worth $149 million,with most of it still in liquid assets,such as cash and securities, for about $125 million in total.That's an increase of more than 19 times from the year before.Fixed assets have also increased by about 10 timesto $11.6 million.On the liability side, Amazon has taken on new debtto finance its growth.The debt level has become $78.2 million,while it was zero the year before.The equity value has also increased to $28.4 million,accounts payable, the other big item, at $32.6 million.Being an online retailer, at least thenthis is not surprising.So is the large cash reserve.The balance sheet in 1996 and 1997clearly reflect what Amazon did in 1997.It issued new equity through its IPO in 1997and also issued new debt.The funds raised were used to expand its business,including substantial investments in fixed assets.What's shown on this slide is Amazon's balance sheetat the end of 2018.By this point, Amazon is already one of the largest companyin the world.The fixed assets have grown to over $61.7 billion,while the total assets have grown to $162 billion.That has also grown to over $23.4 billionin equity to over $43.5 billion.These are all in book value.The market value of Amazon's equity was $773.5 billionat the end of 2018.This slide shows Amazon's acquisitionof Whole Foods, a food retail chain, in 2017at the price of $13.7 billion.This reflects Amazon's expansion into one of the moretraditional retail markets.Amazon financed this purchase by issuing $16 billion of bonds.Clearly, after these transactions,Amazon's asset site will now haveWhole Foods as its new assets, and its liabilities sidewill see an increase of debt by $16 billion.The difference of $2.3 billion will also end upon the asset side, of course.In this course, we will consider corporate finance decisionsin three parts.The first part is capital budgeting,which consists of two topics--first, basic capital budgeting, and two, real options--that is, strategic optionality embedded in real investments.The second part is financing or capital structure.This part consists of three main topics--first, optimal capital structure, second,interaction between investments and financing, and third,payout policy.The third part is on a firm's risk management strategyand its implementation.We will consider basic capital budgeting firstand return to the rest of the corporate financetopics in part 2 of this course after we have developedall the tools needed on asset valuation, riskanalysis, and risk management.

PROFESSOR: We now consider a firm's real investmentor capital budgeting decision.The decision really boils down to the valuationof the investment, or the project under consideration.For simplicity, let's assume that the projectrequires an initial investment of $1 million.And it then yields an expected return,say, x, over the coming year.How can we tell if this is a good project?First, we know that the manager can alwaysreturn the cash to the firm's shareholdersin the form of a dividend, for example.Second, shareholders can easily invest the moneyin the financial market.Suppose that investment opportunitiesin the market with similar timing and riskcharacteristics as the project offeran expected rate of return, r.This then gives us a benchmark to judge the project.We should take the project only if its expected rate of return,x, exceeds r.Otherwise, the shareholders can just take the moneyand invest in the market.Bearing the same risk, they can earn r with no cost and effort.We have first introduced this idea in the introduction.We now provide a more formal treatment.Given an asset or project under evaluation,we define its opportunity cost of capitalas the expected rate of return offeredby equivalent investments in the financial market,where equivalent refers to their timing and riskcharacteristics.The reason for this notion is straightforward.If we are going to invest in the project,we will forego the return offeredby the similar assets traded in a market, whichis easily available.It is important to know that the cost of capitalis always associated with an asset or projectunder consideration, reflecting the market's expectationof the return on the asset.It is not related to factors like the firm'scost of financing by borrowing or other means.Given the opportunity Cost Of Capital, sometimes labeled COC,of a project, the investment decisionbecomes straightforward.If the project yields a return higher than its costof capital, we should take it.Otherwise, we should reject it.In this case, shareholders will be better off not taking it.If they are interested in investing assetswith a similar timing and risk characteristics,they can easily do so in the marketand earn a higher return.We now formalize this idea a little bit more.Suppose that the project has the following cash flow.It requires an initial investment of I today.It yields a future cash flow, CF1 in one year.The opportunity cost of capital for the project is r.What is the value created or destroyedby taking on this project?This is given by the net present value, or NPV,of the project, which is given by the following formula.The NPV should equal to the initial investment, whichis minus I, plus the expected cash flow, CF1, discountedat the cost of capital, r.The decision then becomes straightforward.Take the project only if its NPV is positive.The firm's current market value should thenincrease by the project's NPV when it is taken or knownto be taken.For now, we will assume that the project's cost of capitalis given to us.But from the risk and pricing analysiswe have just developed, we can finda project's cost of capital or expected rate of return easily.All we need to do is to find the risk loadings of the project'sreturn or cash flow.Then by the arbitrage pricing theory, or APT,we can determine the project's required rate of returnby the market.We will return to this part later.

PROFESSOR: In our discussion so far,we have implicitly assumed that a manager's main objectivein making various decisions is to createmore value for the firm's stakeholders or shareholders.In particular, in making corporate financial decisions,the manager's goal is to maximize the current marketvalue of the firm.This seems quite intuitive.But given that this is the startingpoint of our analysis of corporate finance,we would like to give it more careful considerationbefore moving ahead with it.For simplicity, in this part of our analysis,we assume that the firm is wholly ownedby its shareholders.Thus, they are the sole stakeholders of the firm.Such simplification avoids the potential conflicts of interestwhere the firm has different stakeholders,such as bondholders and stockholders.We will return to these situationslater when we examine a firm's financial decisions wheredifferent stakeholders enter the picture.Under the notion that the manager shouldact in the best interests of the firm's shareholders,she faces many factors when making a real investmentdecision.Let's consider a few of these factors.First, each investment has its horizon, namelya timespan for its cash flow, say, one year, five years,or longer.In general, shareholders do care about the timingof a cash flow.Should the manager, for example, favor projects with shorterhorizons other things equal?Next, investments are, in general, riskyand shareholders, on average, risk averse.How should a manager deal with risk?Other things equal, say with the same expected payoff,should the manager always choose projects with lower risks?How about performance measures like earnings?Should the manager always favor projectsyielding higher earnings?How should a manager a balance between near-term earningswith long-term payoffs?Firms often give up short-term benefitsto gain long-term returns, such as market share or new markets.Sometimes, they do so despite the negative reactionsfrom the market arguing that theyare pursuing long-term value.Does this make sense?The list can go on.But what we hope to show is that with the supportof a well-functioning financial market,the only reasonable objective for the firm's manageris to maximize the current market value of the firm.Here are the reasons.First, current market value is an unbiased financialobjective.It is determined and supported by the financial marketand is realizable.You can realize the value of the projectby simply selling the shares in the market.Second, current market value incorporates the market valueof all future cash flows properly adjustedfor timing and risk.Factors like timing and risk are takencare of by the market valuation through the right discountrates or cost of capital.Long-term benefits, if they are recognized by the market,are also fully included in the expectation of future cashflows.Third, current market value is independent of shareholders'differences.We're going to elaborate a little bit more on this point.Again, we start with the notion that a firm's managershould act to help achieving its shareholders'financial objectives.Broadly speaking, shareholders' financial objectivesare two-folded as we have discussedat the beginning of the course.First, to increase wealth, that isto increase the amount of economic resourcesat the household's disposal.This is listed on the slide as objective A.Second, to deploy the wealth to best meet the household'seconomic needs which is to achieve the optimal timepattern and risk profile for its consumption.These are listed as objective B and Crespectively on the slide.It is important to realize that with a well-functioningfinancial market, households can achieve objective Band C through their own transactions in the market.For example, with a $1 in wealth,a household can use it for consumption today or deposit itin the bank account for consumption at any future day.$1 put it in a bank account gives a safe payoffin the future, but if the householdwants more payoff when the economy does well,that is to keep up with the rest of the economy,like a professor to keep up with his students' future successes,the $1 should then be put in the stock market.The household does not need the manager of a firm it invests into do any of these.In fact, it's also impossible for the firm's managerto worry about these decisions as different shareholdersmay have very different financial needsalong these dimensions.However, there is one dimension they have in common.It is objective A to have more wealth.This is where the firm's manager canhelp by increasing the firm's current marketvalue, which goes into a shareholder's wealth.This is why shareholders invest in the firm in the first place.

PROFESSOR: To further illustrate these points,let's consider an example.Suppose that Mass Biz is a company whichis listed on NASDAQ.It is considering two business plans, A and B.They are mutually exclusive.That is, we can only choose one.We have the following information on these two plans.Both plans have positive NPV.Plan A has an NPV of $50 million.That is, if it's taken, the current market valueof the company will increase by $50 million.Plan B has an NPV of $80 million.Plan A pays off in three years and planB pays off in 10 years.In other words, they have quite a different horizons.Plan A expands the firm's current businesswith relatively low risk.Plan B is to enter a new line of business, whichinvolves much higher risk.Which one should the firm take?The CEO is recommending plan B to the boardas it has a higher NPV.$80 million over $50 million.Since Mass Biz grew out of a family business,its board consists of three controlling shareholdersfrom the founding family, grandma, dad, and son.Here are their reactions after hearing from the CEO.Grandma dislikes B. I'm already 85and probably won't be around to see any of its payoffs.Dad is also averse to B. It's too risky.I plan to enjoy a quiet retirementand have little appetite for risk.Son has serious reservations on B.The market is over hyped on the kind of businessB is getting into.As the CEO, how should you respond?Clearly, shareholders' views are dictatedby their own financial objectives and perspectives,which are perfectly reasonable, but also quite divergent.Fortunately, as far as the firm's decision is concerned,it need not to be influenced by shareholder preferences.In particular, by taking plan B, every shareholder's wealthwill increase more by her or his share of the $30 milliondifference immediately.This makes all of them better off.Grandma should not worry about how long it takes for plan Bto pay off.Some investors in the market will live to see these payoffs.That is why they are willing to pay $80 million today for it.If grandma needs money for current use,she can simply sell some of her shares at a high price nowto raise cash.There's no need for dad to worry about the risk of planB. He does not have to bear the risk of plan B. If he prefers,he could sell his shares at a high price now for cashand then use the cash to buy safer assets,like government bonds or low risk stocks, only more of them.Son does not have to agree with the current market prices.The key is that some investors in the marketare willing to pay the price, $80 million,for plan B. If son is not sure about this valuation, again,he can liquidate his shares after taking outplan B at high prices and then get out of the business.What should be clear is that despite the differencein shareholders' preferences and views,plan B will make all of them better off than plan A today.Their current wealth all increase moreat the current market price.This has nothing to do with what they wantto do with this new wealth.In particular, there is no need for any of themto hold their wealth in the form of the firm's stockin order to wait to see its future earningsor bear the risk of the stock or risk a future correctionin the stock price.These are all decisions on how to invest their current wealth.They can make whatever choices accordingto their own preferences or viewsthrough their own transactions in the market.These choices are unrelated to the decisionto increase the current market value of the firm.Therefore, plan B is the right choice for the firmand also for all its shareholders.There are a few caveats worth pointing out here.First, our arguments above rely onlyon two assumptions about the financial market.First, it is well-functioning, meaning accessible to everyonewith no frictions for various transactions.And second, rich, meaning it's efficient for resourceallocation in time and risk.It does not necessarily require that market pricesare correct for whatever that means.In particular, you don't need to agree with the market prices.Second, it is assumed that the shareholders mainlycare about the financial wealth generated from the firm.Given that the firm in this case was a family businessto start with and it's still controlledby the founding family, there mightbe other considerations for the shareholders,such as family name, et cetera.But these considerations can be addressedif needed within our framework.For example, if the family memberswant to hold on to the old business,they can take out plan B to realize its market valueand then sell it through a spinoff, for example.Third, it's assumed that there is no asymmetric information,especially between corporate insiders and the market,nor fake information by the firm.That is, the market valuation on plan A and Breflects all the information available in the market.This is consistent with the efficient markethypothesis we just discussed in the previous lecture.In this case, trading by corporate insiderswon't affect the firm's market prices.

PROFESSOR: Let's consider one more example.Tang Associates is a mining company which owns a gold mine,King Solomon's.It is considering whether to reopen the mine.We have the following data on the mine.The mine has a total deposit of 0.11 million ounces of gold.Extracting the gold takes one year.It requires initial investment of $86 million.Gold is currently traded at $800 per ounce,and the cost of capital for a gold mine is 10%.Here the cost of capital is given to us,but can you think of a way to find this number yourselfusing the valuation methods we developedin lectures on risk, and factor models,and arbitrage pricing theory?In addition, the current shareholdersare evenly split into two groups--optimists, who are bullish on gold prices;and pessimists, who are bearish.In particular, optimists expect the gold priceto increase 20% next year.Pessimists expect the gold price to increase only 5%.Given the difference in their views,the two groups of shareholders may notagree on what the firm should do.For optimists, $1 million, the NPV for reopening the mine,is minus 86, the production cost,plus the present value of future gold sales, whichequals 0.11 million ounces of gold, times the gold price now,which is $800, then times 1 plus the growthrate of 20%, as they expected.Finishing the calculation, we havean NPV of $10 million plus.By this number, Tang should reopen the mine.For pessimists, the NPV is computed similarly,except the growth rate for gold price is expected to be 5%.So the NPV will be minus 86--again, production cost, plus the expected future salesfrom gold, discounted at the 10% of cost of capital.If we finish the calculation, we get minus $2 million,which clearly goes against reopening the mine.What should the firm or the CFO do?Some might suggest taking an average over the two numbers.Why would any of the shareholders agree to this?Each side believes they are right.How about I get the optimists to buy out the pessimists?Interesting idea, but at what price?Maybe you have more creative ideasto resolve this disagreement.Instead of going down further on these paths,let's take a step back and think it over.The key issue here is how to value one ounce of goldnext year.Different shareholders have different views.Don't blame them.If the same question was put to us, most likely we won't agree.But wait a minute.All we need to know is not about the price of gold next year,but the present value of one ounceof gold in one year but today.A little poking around about the gold market--a very active market.We learned the following--gold, at least those traded in the market,such as gold bullions and coins, is mostlyheld as a long-term investment with no interim payoffs.It is often viewed as a storage valueor hedge against inflation.If so, for these gold investors, one ounce of gold of next yearis the same as one ounce of gold today.If they buy one ounce of gold today, most likelythey will hold it until next year anyway, or even longer.In the interim, there's no payoff from the gold.This is different from holding a bond or stock, whichmay pay coupons or dividends during the year.Holding gold incurs little cost either.Physical gold is mostly stored at gold depositorieswith very low cost.It is the claims on them that change hands wheninvestors buy and sell them.We will return to this market later in Part 2,when we study derivative securities on commodities.From the above observation, we thenconclude that one ounce of gold in one yearis worth the same amount as one ounce of gold today.Given that one ounce of gold is trading at $800 now,the present value of one ounce of gold in one yearis also $800 today.Immediately, we can conclude that the NPV of reopeningthe mine is simply minus 86--again, the production cost--plus 0.11 million ounces of gold times the present valueof one ounce of gold in one year, and that's $800.Finishing that calculation, we get plus $2 million,which is positive.This value is the value we can achieve today in the market--the current price for selling one ounce of golddelivered next year is $800.Therefore, by reopening the mine,the value of Tang Associates will increase immediatelyby $2 million, which will make all shareholders richer.As for the shareholders themselves,with their own views on future gold prices,they can use the market to speculate on their forecasts.For example, for their pessimistic shareholders,they can sell the shares at a high price now.If that is not enough, they can even short gold in the market.

PROFESSOR: Now let's wrap-up our discussionson the objectives of the firm's financial manager.We have three important results.First, the manager should always maximizethe firm's current market value, whichis independent of shareholders' individual characteristics.Second, shareholders' financial differencescan be settled in the financial market on their own.They can utilize the wealth created by the firmto meet their own consumption, saving,and investment needs separately independent from the firm'sdecisions.Third with a rich and well-functioningfinancial market, sometimes also called a perfect market,there can be a potential separation between ownershipand management.As long as the management adheres to value maximizationas the objective, they don't needto be attached to the shareholdersor their preferences and views.The actual financial market is not 100% perfect, of course,although for mature markets, it could bequite close in many dimensions.Imperfections can lead to many additional issues.We only list a few important ones here.The first point is that a firm mayhave different stakeholders, such as bond holdersin addition to stockholders.Their interests, they will not always be aligned.In particular, bondholders are mostlyconcerned about getting their principal back and interestpaid.They care more about the downsideof the firm than the upside.Shareholders, on the other hand, care moreabout the upside than the downside.These differences can influence a firm's financial decisionsunder certain circumstances.Second, with separation of management from ownership,the management may not always act in the best interestof the firm's owners.Instead, they may put their own interests first.In this situation, management is alsoreferred to as the agent of the principle, which is the owner.The conflict of interests is also called the agency problem.Our three conclusions above dependcritically on the well-functioning financialmarket.In the presence of certain market imperfections,such as transaction costs, asymmetric information,and taxes, some of these results will need to be modified.For now, we will focus on corporate finance decisionswith a perfect financial market.We will return to the influence of market imperfectionsin part two of this course.

#### 415-1x_Rec 9_Corporate Financial Decisions-en

PROFESSOR: To carry on business, a corporationneeds real assets.For example, in order to produce cars,Tesla Motors needs a factory to assemble them.In corporate finance, a decision to build a factoryis what we refer to as an investment decision.Investment decisions are the most important decisions madeby the management of any firm.A firm's management must weigh the costs and benefitsof all investments and projects and decide which of themqualify as good uses of the money stockholdershave invested in the firm.These investment decisions fundamentallyshape what the firm does and whether itwill add value for its owners.In this course, we will develop the toolsnecessary to make good investment decisions.Investment decisions are often referred toas capital budgeting decisions.Once management has decided which investments to make,they also decide how to pay for them.Large investments may require the corporationto raise additional money.Management must decide whether to raise more moneyfrom new and existing owners by selling more shares of stockor to borrow the money.In this course, we will discuss the characteristicsof each source of funds and how to decidewhich one to use in the context of the corporation'soverall mix of debt and equity.We call such decisions financing decisions.Let's consider an example.In summer 2018, Tesla Motors started developing and buildinga factory in Shanghai called Tesla Giga Shanghai.Their facility's currently producing final assembliesof the Tesla Model 3 and will produceTesla Model Y, with delivery slatedto begin in January 2021.This is an example of investment decision.Now, in May 2019, Tesla issued and sold around2,750,000 shares.In addition, around the same time,Tesla issued convertible notes, whichis a type of instrument that has characteristics of both equityand debt, with the total value of around $1.35 billion.Both the issuance of shares and the issuanceof convertible notes are examples of financing decisionsby Tesla.In addition to investment and financing decisions,management must ensure that the firmhas enough cash on hand to meet its day-to-day obligations.This job, commonly known as working capital management,may seem straightforward, but in a young and growing company,it can mean the difference between success and failure.Even companies with great productsrequire significant amounts of moneyto develop and bring those products to market.For example, developing Airbus 380 cost billions of eurosand took seven years.A company typically burns through a significant amountof cash developing a new product before its sales generateincome.It is the job of Chief Financial Officer, or the CFO,to make sure that access to cash does nothinder the firm's success.When a firm generates sufficient cash flow,it must decide how to use that cash.If the firm has new investment opportunities,it can reinvest the cash and increase the value of the firm.Many young, rapidly growing firmsreinvest 100% of their cash flows in this way.But mature, profitable firms oftenfind that they generate more cashthan they need to fund all of their attractive investmentopportunities.An example of such firms would be Apple and Microsoftright now.When the firm has excess cash, itcan hold those funds as part of its cash reservesor pay the cash out to shareholders.If the firm decides to follow the latter approach,it has two choices.First, it can pay a dividend, or second, itcan repurchase shares from the current owners.These decisions represent the firm's payout policy.In this course, we will discuss what determines a firm's payoutpolicy.Another important corporate financial decisionis risk management.All firms are subject to risk from a variety of sources,changes in consumer tastes and demand for their products,fluctuations in the cost of raw materials,employee turnover, the entry of new competitors,and countless other uncertainties.Entrepreneurs and corporate managers willinglytake on these risks in the pursuit of high returnsand accept them as part of the costs of doing business,but as with any other cost, firmsmust manage risk to minimize the effecton the value of the firm.The primary method of risk management is prevention.For example, firms can avoid or at leastreduce any potential risks by making prudent investmentdecisions and by conducting appropriate due diligence whenentering into new relationships.But some risks are too costly to preventand are inevitable consequences of running a business.The firm shares these business riskswith its investors, who buy securities issued by the firm.For example, some of the risk is passed onto debt holders, whobear the risk that the firm will default, but most of the riskis typically passed to equity holders, whoare exposed to the volatility of the stock's return.Both types of investors can reduce their riskby holding the firm securities ina well-diversified portfolio.In this course, we will consider the strategiesthat firms use to manage and reduce the risk borneby the investors.We will learn how firms can use financial markets to offloadthe risk associated with changes in commodity pricesand interest rate movements.

PROFESSOR: In this video, I wouldlike to introduce you to an important tool frequently usedin corporate finance to analyze corporate financialtransactions.It's called market-value balance sheet.Market-value balance sheet is similar to a "regular," quote,unquote, balance sheet that I put herefor comparison on the right-hand side with the differencethat both assets and liabilities sideof the market-value balance sheetare quoted in market values, not book values.We traditionally distinguish two important partsof the liability side of the balance sheet, namely debtand equity.And we quote both of them in market valueswhich, here, I denote as MV.And equity would also be quoted in market values, notbook values.On the left-hand side of the balance sheet,we have our assets which, again, consistof cash and long-term assets, which would alsobe measured and quoted in the market values and not bookvalues.For comparison, we can see that, in the regular balancesheet on the right, that equity and assetsare quoted in their book values and not their market values.Different corporate financial transactionsmay have different impact on the market-value balance sheetand on the regular balance sheet.And here, we will consider several examples.Suppose a firm uses cash to build a factory.For example, Tesla uses its available cashto build a new production facility.What impact does this transactionhave on both regular balance sheetand on the market-value balance sheet?Let's start with the regular balance sheet.Let me schematically draw it.In here, I'm going to separate the assetsinto cash and other assets, which I will call LTA, whichstands for Long-Term Asset.In this particular transaction, the firmuses part of its cash to build additional long-term assets.In this case, it's a factory.So therefore, it just turns one part of its assetsinto another one.And therefore, this transaction hasno impact on the right-hand side of this balance sheet.So in other words, neither the book value of thatnor the book value of equity are affected as a resultof this transaction.Now, things are slightly more interestingfor the market-value balance sheet.Let me also schematically draw it, and alsoseparate assets into cash, and into long-term assets.Let's assume for a moment that this transaction is a zero NPVtransaction.So then, in this case, the company again just uses cashto build a factory.And it doesn't create additional value on its balance sheet.However, if this transaction has positive net-present value,then as a result of this transaction,the total value of long-term assetsis going to increase more than the decrease in the cashthat we use to build this factory.So therefore, we're creating this additional valueas a result of this transaction, which again reflectsthe fact that the net-present value of this transactionis positive.Now, in this case, the right-hand side of this balancesheet has to increase.And this increase has to be proportional with this NPVso that the left-hand side of the balance sheetequals to the right-hand side of this balance sheet.Now, this additional value can accrueto either existing equity holders or existing debtholders.So this is debt, and this is equity.This depends on the extent to which the original debt wassafe or risky, so something that wewill talk more about in the second part of this course.If we for a moment assume that this positive NPV accrues onlyto the equity holders, then as a result of this transaction,the market value of equity is going to go upby the amount of this NPV.And so this new part would be the new value of equity.And we will see this in an increase in the share price.So when the firm announces that it has plansand it uses its existing cash to build a new factory,the stock price and the market value of equityis going to increase by the amountof this net present value that this transaction creates.Let's consider a second example.Suppose that a CEO of a firm dies in a plane crash.What impact does this tragic event have on the regularand on the market-value balance sheets of this firm?Let's start with the regular balance sheet.Let me schematically draw it here again.So we have assets on the left.We have debt and equity on the right.Now, it is very clear that this transaction hasno impact on neither the book value of assets,because they stay intact, nor on the book value of debtor the equity of this firm.So in other words, this event hasno impact on the regular balance sheet at all.When it comes to the market-value balance sheet,things are more interesting.Suppose for a moment that the old CEO was a great CEO,and the new CEO is not as good.In this case then, the market value of assets will decline.And let us assume that it is decliningby this much to reflect this value loss.This value loss is going to come from the factthat the plans that the original CEO had for the firmwill not materialize.And this firm will not be as prosperousas it would have been if it was run by the original CEO.So the market value of assets of this firmis going to be this smaller part on this chart.Now, this value loss, of course, hasto be reflected on the right as well.And so the right-hand side of the balance sheetis going to shrink by exactly this much.And this value loss can accrue to both equity holders and debtholders of this firm.Again, it depends on how risky the original debt was--something that we'll cover in the second part of this course.But it is almost universally the casethat the value of equity of this firmis going to decline as a result of this event.And so therefore, we're going to seethat the stock price reaction is going to be negative.And the market value of equity of this firmis going to decline.Let's consider a third and final example.Suppose a firm issues debt to pay a dividend.What impact does this transactionhave on the regular and on the market-value balance sheets?First, let's start with the regular balance sheet.This transaction increases the book value of debtby this much.So suppose that this is how much we'retaking on to pay the dividend.And it decreases the book value of equityby the corresponding amount, because thisis how much dividend we pay to our existing equity holders.So therefore, this is the additional amount of new debt.And this is by how much the new debt grows.And this is by how much equity shrinks.And so this is the new value of equity of this firm.Notice that this transaction has no impact on the left-hand sideof this balance sheet, so the book value of assetsstays intact.Now let's see how this transaction impactsthe market-value balance sheet.So first, the market value of debtwill increase to reflect the market value of this new debtthat we're issuing to pay a dividend.And this would be the new total market value of debtthat this firm will have.The market value of equity will decline proportionallywith the amount of dividend that we pay to our shareholders.And so therefore, together, these transactionsor these impacts are similar to whatwe've seen happening on the regular balancesheet in book-value terms.However, these may not be the only effectsthat are happening.Suppose that investors positivelyinterpret this information.And as a result, the market value of equityincreases by this much.This increase in the value of equityhas to be reflected on the left-hand sideof this market-value balance sheet as well.And therefore, the market value of assetshas to increase by this much as well.So therefore, this transaction has this additional impacton the market-value balance sheet.So altogether, the market value of debt increases.The market value of equity decreases, but notas much as it would have been if there was notthis additional informational impact.And the left-hand side, or the market-valueof assets of this firm, increases as a resultof this transaction.Overall, in finance, we're interested in understandinghow various transactions affect the market value of debt,the market value of equity, and the marketvalue of assets of the firm.Therefore, we primarily focus our attentionon the market-value balance sheet,as opposed to the regular balance sheet.And therefore, it has an important roleas a tool in finance.

#### 415-1x_Rec 9_Opportunity Cost of Capital-en

PROFESSOR: Suppose a firm wants to invest in the project.For example, recently Apple started its TV+ service,which competes with Netflix, HBO,and other media services providers and productioncompanies.To evaluate this decision, Apple needs to project future cashflows TV+ will generate and discount them to present.Now, what discount rate should beused to evaluate this investment decision?The answer to this question is that Appleshould use expected return offeredin the market on an investment of comparable risk.To understand why, suppose Apple seeks to raise capital fromoutside investors to finance its investment in TV+.In order to attract funds, the firmmust offer an expected return comparable to whatinvestors could earn elsewhere with the same risk and horizon.But what if Apple can fund this project internally?As of March 2020, Apple has more than $40 billion in cashon its balance sheet, clearly enough to fund any project.What discount rate should Apple use in order to determinewhether they should invest in TV+ if they can fund thisproject internally.The answer is the same rate as theywould use if they financed the project with outside investorsmoney.This is because any funds invested in the new projectcould be returned to shareholdersto invest elsewhere.The new project should be taken only if it offers a betterreturn than shareholders other investment opportunities.We call the discount rate, the opportunity cost of capitalor simply the cost of capital for the project.The opportunity cost of capital is the best availableexpected return offered in the marketon an investment of comparable risk and termto the cash flows being discounted.The opportunity cost of capital provides the benchmarkagainst which the cash flows of the new investmentsshould be evaluated.For a risk-free project, it will typicallycorrespond to the interest rate on US treasury securitieswith similar term.The cost of capital for risky projectswill often exceed this amount, depending on the natureand magnitude of the risk.We will develop tools for estimatingthe cost of capital for risky projects later in the course.An important implication of this insightis that the cost of capital for a specific projectmay differ from the cost of capital for the entire firm.In our example, can we use Apple's cost of capitalfor the entire firm as the cost of capital for the TV+ project.The answer is no.Apple's primary source of revenueis iPhone, which is a different product from the mediaproduction and distribution business.In order to evaluate TV+ service,we need to use cost of capital of firms engaged in mediabusiness, such as Netflix.

PROFESSOR: In theory, the goal of a firmshould be determined by the firm's owners.A sole proprietorship has a single owner who runs the firm.So the goals of a sole proprietorshipare the same as the owner's goals.But in organizational forms with multiple owners,the appropriate goal of the firm is not as clear.Many corporations have thousands of owners.Each owner is likely to have different interestsand priorities.Whose interests and priorities determinethe goals of the firm?You might be surprised to learn that the interestsof shareholders are aligned for many, if not most,important decisions.That is because, regardless of their own personal financialposition and stage in life, all the shareholderswill agree that they are better off if managementmakes decisions that increase the value of their shares.For example, between January 2013 and June 2018,the stock price of Netflix has increased almost 30 times.Clearly, regardless of their preferencesand other differences, all investorswho held shares of Netflix stock over this periodhave benefited from the investment decisionsthat managers of Netflix have made.But even when all the owners of a corporationagree on the goals of the corporation,these goals must be implemented.And in simple organizational form,like a sole proprietorship, the owner who runs the firmcan ensure that the firm's goals matched his or her own.But a corporation is run by a management teamseparate from its owners, giving rise to conflicts of interest.How can the owner of a corporationensure that the management team will implement their goals?Because of the separation of ownership and controlin a corporation, managers have little incentiveto work in the interest of the shareholderswhen this means working against their own self-interest.This is called an agency problem when managers,despite being hired as agents of shareholders,put their own self-interest ahead of the interestsof shareholders.This agency problem is commonly addressed, in practice,by minimizing the number of decisions managersmust make for which their own self-interest substantiallydiffers from the interests of the shareholders.For example, managers' compensation contractsare designed to ensure that most decisions in the shareholders'interests are also in the manager's interests.Shareholders often tie the compensation of top managersto the corporation's profits and to its stock price.There is, however, a limitation to the strategy.By tying compensation too closely to performance,the shareholders might be asking managers to take on more riskthan they are comfortable taking.As a result, managers may make decisionsthat are too conservative.On the other hand, if compensation contractsreduce managers risk by rewarding good performancebut limiting the penalty associatedwith poor performance, managers may have an incentiveto take excessive risk.Another way shareholders can encourage managers to workin the interests of shareholders is to discipline them if theydon't.If shareholders are unhappy with the CEO's performance,they could, in principle, pressure the boardto oust the CEO.In 2019, for example, CEOs of Warner Brothers,Under Armor, Nike, and Boeing were all reportedlyforced to resign by their boards.Despite this high profile as examples,directors and top executives are rarelyreplaced through a grassroots shareholders uprising.Instead, dissatisfied investors oftenchoose to sell their shares.When the stock performs poorly, the board of directorsmight react by replacing the CEO.In some corporations, however, the senior executivesare entrenched because boards of directorsdo not have the will to replace them.Often the reluctance to fire happensbecause the board members are close friends of the CEOand lack objectivity.In corporations in which the CEO is entrenched and doinga poor job, the expectation of continued poor performancewill decrease the stock price.But low stock prices create a profit opportunity.In a hostile takeover, an individual or organization,sometimes known as a corporate raider,can purchase a large fraction of the stockand acquire enough votes to replace the board of directorsand the CEO.With a new superior management team,the stock is a much more attractive investment,which will likely result in the price rise and a profitfor the corporate raider and the other shareholders.Although the words "hostile" and "raider"have negative connotations, corporate "raiders"themselves provide an important service to shareholders.The mere threat of being removed as a resultof a hostile takeover is often enough to disciplinebad managers and motivate boards of directorsto make difficult decisions.Consequently, when a corporation's sharesare publicly traded, a market for corporate controlis created that encourages managers and boardsof directors to act in the interestsof their shareholders.Further potential for conflicts of interestand ethical considerations arise whensome stakeholders in the corporation benefit and otherslose from a decision.Shareholders and managers are two stakeholdersin the corporation.But others include the regular employeesand the communities in which the company operates, for example.Managers may decide to take the interest of other stakeholdersinto account in their decisions, such as keeping a lossgenerating factory open because it is the main provider of jobsin a small town, paying above market wagesto factory workers in a developing country,or operating a plant at a higher environmental standardthan local law mandates.In some cases, these actions that benefit other stakeholdersalso benefit the firm's shareholdersby creating a more dedicated workforce, generatingpositive publicity with customers,and other indirect effects.In other instances, when these decisionsbenefit other stakeholders at shareholders' expense,they represent a form of corporate charity.Indeed, many, if not most, corporations explicitlydonate on behalf of their shareholdersto local and global charitable and political causes.For example, biotechnology firm Gilead Sciencesdonated $388 million in 2017 to charitable causes,making it the largest contributor in 2017.These actions are costly and they reduce shareholder wealth.Thus, while some shareholders might support such policiesbecause they feel that they reflecttheir own moral and ethical priorities,it is unlikely that all shareholderswill feel this way, leading to potential conflictsof interest among shareholders.Now, what about society at large?Are decisions that increase the value of the firm's equitybeneficial for society as a whole?Most often they are.While shareholders of Netflix have become much richer,its customers also are better offwith the quality and availability of streamingcontent that they might otherwise never have had,which might be especially valuable during the crisistimes, such as COVID-19.But even if the corporation only makes its shareholdersbetter off, as long as nobody elseis made worse off by its decisions,increasing the value of equity is good for society.The problem occurs when increasing the value of equitycomes at the expense of others.Consider a corporation that, in the course of its business,pollutes the environment and does not pay the costto clean up the pollution.Alternatively, a corporation may not itselfpollute but use of its products may harm the environment.In such cases, decisions that increase shareholder wealthcan be costly for society as a whole.In economics, we refer to such casesas negative externalities.When the actions of the corporationimpose harm on others in the economy,appropriate public policy and regulationis required to assure that corporate interestsand societal interests remain aligned.Sound public policies should allowfirms to continue to pursue their maximizationof shareholder value in a way that benefits society overall.

PROFESSOR: We now focus on a firm's capital budgetingdecisions.The objective is to increase the firm's current market value.The decision depends on the valuation of each projectunder consideration.Consider a project with cash flow from now to year t.Let's cf0 be the initial cash flow and cf1 to cftbe its expected future cash flows.Let the discount rate be r1 to rt for the corresponding cashflows.The NPV of the project is then givenby the following discounted cash flow formula.It is simply the sum of the present values of allthe pieces in the cash flow.This gives the increase in the firm's current marketvalue if the project is taken.With the NPV of each project available to the firm,we can easily write down the decision rule on investmentsor capital budgeting.For a single project, take it only if its NPV is positive.For multiple independent projects,take all those with positive NPVs.Here, independent means the projectsare unrelated to each other.An example of independent projectsis to develop condos in far apart cities.For mutually exclusive projects, take the onewith positive and the highest MPV.Here, mutually exclusive means we can only do one.An example of mutually exclusive projectsis when to build the same condo--right now, next year, or later.Now, all we need to do is to compute the project's NPV.This requires three inputs.First, its cash flow--more precisely, its expected cash flow.Second, the right discount rates for the cash flow.Third, strategic options embedded in the projectbeyond the basic casual forecasts.We will focus merely on one here and return to two and threelater in part two of the course.Before we get into the details of figuring outthe cash flow of the project, several general pointsare worth mentioning.First, for valuation purposes, weneed to use actual cash flows, not accounting earnings.Although we often rely on accounting informationto learn about a project's cash flow,we have to do so carefully.Earnings reported in accounting statementsfollow certain accounting rules whichmay not adhere to the actual timing of the cash flow.As we already know, timing is a key element in valuationand needs to be captured accurately.We will see examples on this point soon.Second, use after tax cash flows.We have already made this point when we first discussedthe present value calculation.Shareholders or investors only careabout the cash flow they actually receive after taxes.In the corporate finance context,firms do have to pay corporate taxes.Third, it is important that we onlyinclude cash flows attributable to the project.This will then give us the net gainfrom the project in firm value.This leads to various implicationswhen computing a project's cash flows.Here, we list a few.One, use incremental cash flows.There's no need to include unrelated cash flowssince we only care about the net value added by the project.Two, ignore sunk costs.These are cash flows associated with previous decisions,not the current decision, which isabout the current and future cash flows.Let the bygones be bygones, as people say.Third, include investments in working capital.Fourth, include opportunity cost of using existing facility,losing existing cells, and so on.We can go on, but instead of talking about these pointsin abstract, we will illustrate them through a set of examples.Before doing so, we want to give a formal definitionof a project's cash flow, which is givenby the equation on this slide.The net cash flow equals cash inflow minus cash outflow.The project's cash inflow is simply its operating revenue.The outflow, however, consists of three pieces.First, operating expenses without depreciation.Second, taxes.And last, capital expenditures.This is summarized in the second equation.We can also rewrite a project's cash flowin a slightly different way.First, we define the project's operating profitas its operating revenue net of operating expenseswithout depreciation again.Next, we consider taxes.Let the project's effective tax rate be tau.Then the projects income tax willbe the tax rate tau times the operating profit thenminus the tax rate times the depreciation.This second term comes from the tax creditthe firm can claim from its capital investments.Here, we note that accounting depreciationitself is not a cash flow, but it does affect the project'safter tax cash flow because it can be usedto reduce the firm's tax bill.Putting things together, we have the following.The net cash flow of the project equals 1 minus tautimes the operating profit, whichis the after tax profit, minus capital expenditureplus the tax credit from depreciation.

INSTRUCTOR: What we will do next isto go over a series of examples to demonstratehow to compute a project's cash flow from its financial data.Naturally, these examples are simplified comparedto real projects, but they do provide useful illustrationsof how to come up with cash flow estimatesin various situations.For the first example is about the distinctionbetween accounting earnings and actual cash flows.The project we're considering is as follows.It requires a purchase of a machine for $1 millionwith a life of 10 years.The machine will generate an annual revenue of $300,000at an operating expense of $100,000.The machine can be depreciated over its lifespanusing straight-line depreciation.The corporate tax rate is 40%.The financial information on the projectis summarized in the table.The first column gives the year.The second column gives the project's pre-tax accountingearnings.Starting from year 1, it is revenueminus expense minus depreciation,which equals 300, which is revenueminus 100, which is expense minus 100,which is the depreciation.And that gives $100,000 of pre-tax earnings.The third column gives the after-tax earnings,starting from year 1.That is 1 minus the tax rate times the earnings, whichis $60,000.However, we should note that you wouldbe incorrect to simply discount the after-tax earningsat the cost of capital to get the NPV.The reason is that the accounting earnings did notaccurately reflect the timing of the project's cash flow.For example, the initial expenditure, or sometimescalled CapEx of $1 million on the machineis not recorded as a cash flow in year 0.Instead, it shows up in the form of depreciationas part of the expense over the next 10 years.For evaluation purposes, we cannot arbitrarily shift cashflows over time without proper discounting.In order to value the cash flows,we have to capture the amount and timing correctly.The actual cash flow from the projectis given in column 4 in the table.It's computed as follows.In year 0, the cash flow is minus 1 million,the CapEx amount paid at that time.In year 1, the after-tax cash flowequals the after-tax profit plus the tax creditfrom depreciation.The first part equals 1 minus 0.4, the tax rate,times the operating profit, which is 300 minus 100,revenue minus expense, or $200,000.This gives an after-tax profit of 120K.The second part equals 0.4, the tax rate,times the annual depreciation of $100,000, which gives 40K.The sum of the two gives the total after-tax cashflow of $160,000.We have the same after-tax cash flow for the remaining years.It is obvious that the actual after-tax cashflow is quite different from the after-tax accounting earnings.This could be substantial.In fact, no matter what discount rate we use,that this kind of value for all accounting earningswill always be positive.This is because accounting earningsare positive for all years, 60,000 every year.But if we use actual cash flows, the answer is different.For high enough of a cost of capital, the NPV of the projectbecomes negative.For example, you could try a discount rate of 10%.This example shows that accounting earnings are notthe same as actual cash flows.However, if used properly, we can figure out the cash flowfrom the accounting information.Our next example focuses on taxes.The project's cash flow are given in the table,which are in thousand dollars.Assume its tax rate is 50%.The project spans from year 0, which is now, to year 5,as shown in row 1.It requires an initial investment of 500,shown in row 2.The operating profit given in the third row is 0 in year 1,100 year 2, 300 in year 3, et cetera.That's given in row 3.Let's assume that the initial capital investment of 500can be depreciated linearly over the five years to 0 at the end.This then gives a depreciation of 100from year 1 to year 5 in the fourth row.Know that depreciation does not represent the actual cash flow,but they can be used to reduce taxes.Row 5 uses the accounting income,which is the difference between operating profitand depreciation.We have minus 100 in year 1, 0 in year 2, 200 in year 3,and so on.As seen from the previous example,this is not the actual income because depreciation is notitself a cash flow.Row 6 gives the tax, which is the taxrate times the operating cash flow,minus the tax rate times depreciation, the tax credit.This also equals the tax rate times the accounting income.We then have minus 50 in year 1, 0 in year 2,100 in year 3, et cetera.The after-tax cash flow from the project, given in row 7,equals operating cash flow minus capital expenditureminus the tax.We then have 500 minus, for year 0, 50 for year 1,100 for year 2, and so on.There is one caveat here, however.In year 1, the operating cash flow is 0,and we have a tax bill of minus 50,which means a tax credit of 50.We won't be able to get the tax authority, why is this amount.However, if the firm has other incomesit needs to pay taxes on, this tax creditcan be used to reduce the tax bill on these incomes.$1 saved is $1 earned.If we can fully utilize this tax credit to save taxes,it is then equivalent to generating a $50,000 cash flow.This is what we assume here, for simplicity.If this tax credit cannot be fully utilized in year 1,we can then carry it forward to reduce taxes in the followingyears, when there is income.All we have to do, then, is to properly discountthe corresponding tax benefits.If the cost of capital for this project is 10%,we can then discount its cash flow after tax.The NPV we got is $39,000, roughly.And that's positive.This example shows how we need to treat taxes carefullyin coming up with a project's cash flows.

PROFESSOR: A project's cash flowscan arise in different accounting forms.One of them is change in inventory.Let's consider a simple example.Suppose that you are running a chain of shoe stores.The financials are as follows.This quarter, you buy 1 million pairsof shoes at a price of $30 each.You expect to sell all of them in the next twoquarters, 500,000 per quarter at a price of $60.The effective tax rate is 40%.What are the cash flows for this project?The financial data are summarized in the table.The first column is time in quarters.The second column gives the after tax accounting profit.In quarter 0, it's $0.In quarter 1, the accounting profitis sales, which is $0.5 million times profit margin, whichis $60 minus $30, the sale price minus costsfor each pair of shoes then times 1 minus the tax rate.This gives an after tax accounting profit of $9 millionper quarter.But this is not the actual after tax cash rule.In particular, the cost of shoes are paid in quarter 0in the form of inventory, not in quarter 1 and 2.There are different ways to deal with this issue.One way is to directly go after the project's cash flow, whichis given in the last column in a table.In particular, in quarter 0, we paid a total of $30 millionfor an inventory of 1 million pairs of shoes at $30 a pair.This is a cash flow of minus $30 million.In quarter 1, the revenue is 0.5 million pairsof shoes sold times the sales price of $60.That gives us $30 million.The tax bill is operating profit,which is 0.5 million times $60 minus $30,times the tax rate of 40%, which gives $6 million.Net of the two items gives an after tax cash flowof $24 million.It's repeated in quarter 2.Another way is to look also at the inventory, which isgiven in column 3 in the table.Since inventory carries a price, its changeimplies a cash flow-- in particular,a change in inventory implies an opposite cash flowof the same amount.Therefore, for quarter 0, inventoryincreases by $30 million.It implies a cash flow of minus $30 million, the amount of cashpaid for that inventory.For quarter 1 and 2, inventory decreases by $15 millionrespectively.Yet that implies a cash flow of plus $15 million,the amount recouped from selling the inventory.If we add these implied cash flows to the after taxaccounting profit, the cash flow will be 0 minus $30 million.That equals minus $30 million in quarter 0.$9 plus $15, which equals $24 millionin quarter 1 and quarter 2.This is the same as what we have obtained previouslyin the last column.From this, we see that with changing inventory,a project's cash flow can also be computed as its after taxaccounting profit minus the change in inventory,which is given in the equation at the bottom of the slide.In general, there are timing differencesbetween the accounting measure of earnings or profit,which is given by sales minus cost of goods soldand the actual cash flows.This is specifically reflected in changes in working capital,which includes several parts.A simple definition of working capital is as follows.It equals inventory plus accounts receivableminus accounts payable.As we have seen from the previous example,changes in working capital such as inventoryimplied actual cash flows.Let's consider this in more detail.First, inventory.In computing earnings and profits, the cost of goods soldincludes the cost of items sold in that period.The actual cost of these items may occur in different periods.When inventory is rising, the cost of goods soldunderstates the cash outflows.When inventory is falling, the cost of goods soldoverstates the cash outflows.The second item is accounts receivable.Accounting sales may include salesthat have not been paid for, whichgoes into accounts receivable.Therefore, accounting sales understate cash inflowsif the firm is receiving payments from past sales.This corresponds to decreases in accounts receivable.The third item in working capital is accounts payable.Conceptually, this is just the reverse of accounts receivable.Therefore, with changing working capital,the after tax cash flow of a projectneeds to include an additional term, which is minusthe change in working capital as shownin the equation on this slide.

PROFESSOR: At last, we will consider a capital budgetingexample that is slightly richer than the previous examples.MSW Inc. is a small manufacturing companyselling widgets.It is now considering the launch of the next generationof widgets, Turbo-Widgets, or TW for short.The data on TW is as follows.TW was developed over the last three yearsat an R&D cost of $1 million.Producing TW requires a new machine,which costs $2 million.The new machine lasts 15 years, with a salvage valueof $50,000 at the end.The new machine can be depreciated linearly to 0over 10 years.TW needs to be painted.This can be done using the excess capacity of existingpainting machines, which cost $30,000 to run, independentof how much it's used.Operating cost is $40,000 per year.TW sales are expected to be $400,000 per year.But cannibalization will reduce existing salesof regular widgets to drop by $20,000.Working capital is $250,000, whichcan be recovered at the end of the project.MSW's tax rate is 34%, and its cost of capital is 10%.The question we want to answer is should TW be launched now?Let's go down the list to identify each piece of the cashflow for this project, its incremental cash flow.The R&D expense is sunk cost.It should not be included, of course.CapEx of $2 million for the machineis a cash outflow in year 0.Of course, that should be included.Depreciation of $2 million over 10 years--that is, $0.2 million for each year from year1 to 10, that's for tax purposes.Salvage value of the machine of $50,000 in year 15is an income, but fully taxable.This is because the book value of the machinealready hits 0 in year 10.The project should not be charged for painting.The painting machine is running anyway at no additional cost.Operating costs and sales should be included, of course.However, loss of existing sales shouldbe charged to the project against its sales.Working capital is also an initial investment,but recovered in year 15.Adding up the different pieces, we thenhave the cash flow of Turbo-Widgets from year 0to 15 in $1,000.In year 0, the cash flow is minus $2,000 CapExplus $250, the working capital.That gives us minus $2,250.In year 1 to 10, the cash flow is after tax profit,which is $400.So sales minus $40--that's the expenses-- minus $20.That's actually the cannibalizationof existing sales.And then times 1 minus 0.34--that's the tax rate--plus the tax credit from depreciation,which is 200 times 0.34.The sum is $292.4 thousand.From year 11 to 14, there's no more depreciation, no more taxcredit.The cash flow is just the after tax profit, which is $224.4.In year 15, the cash flow has three pieces.The first piece is the after tax profit, which is 224.4.The second piece is the after tax salvagevalue of the machine, which is 50 times 1 minus 0.34.Because we have to pay taxes on it.The third piece is the working capital recovered.Adding them up gives a total of $507.4 thousand.At the cost of capital of 10%, the NPV of Turbo-Widgetsis minus $57.6 thousand, which is negative.Therefore, we should not launch it now.This example merely illustrates some issueswe need to pay attention to informing cash flowforecasts for a project, given its financials.

PROFESSOR: Given a project's cash flow forecasts,all we need are the corresponding discountrates to compute the NPV.For the discount rates, we have learned the following.First, the project's discount rate,which is also called the required rate of returnor the cost of capital, is the expected rateof return demanded by investors in the market for the projectand for similar traded assets.Second, discount rate depends on the timing and riskof the cash flow.Thus, in general, it can be different for different piecesof a cash flow.Third, discount rate is in general different for differentprojects.Fourth, it is in general incorrect to usea company-wide cost of capital to discountcash flows of all projects.The cost of capital is project-specificand can vary substantially across different projectswith different risks.What is the discount rate of a project?In the simple case, a single discount ratecan be used for all cash flows of a project.This is mostly an approximation.In the general case, we need to use different discountrates for different cash flows dependingon their timing and risk.For example, even with safe cash flows, $1 in different yearsshould be discounted at different interest ratesif the term structure of interest ratesis not flat, as we have learned from the fixed income market.We will return to the determination of discount rateslater by applying the risk analysis and asset pricingtools we have been developing.But in this lecture, we will use a single discount rate mainlyfor simplicity.Often, we face multiple projects.As a firm, there are almost unlimited numberof projects it can take.The key is to find the good ones--namely, those with positive NPVs.For mutually independent projects,we can simply apply the NPV rule to each project.This implies that we would take up all the projectswith positive NPVs.For projects dependent of each other--in particular, mutually exclusive--we then have to compare the NPVs and pick the highest one,assuming it is positive.To illustrate this point, let's consider a simple example.You have just developed a new product.The decision now is when to bring it to the market--say, in year one, two, three, or four.If we view each choice as the project itself,then the timing decision is between a setof mutually exclusive projects.We can launch the project only once.Several factors can influence the cash flow forecastsand the timing decision.For example, the demand for the product may increase over time.In addition, launching it early will alsocause your competitors to catch up sooner.Let's assume the opportunity cost of capital for the projectis 10%.We can compute the NPV for each launching dateat the time of launch.We denote this by FPV, the project's future present value.The numbers are reported in the table.If launched in year one, the NPV then is $100 million.If instead launched in year two, three, and four,the FPV will be $120, $138, and $149 millionrespectively as shown by row two to five in the table.Clearly, by waiting, the FPV increases.But how long should we wait?There are two ways to resolve this.First, we can consider the rate of return by waiting.If we wait until year two, the value appreciates by 20%as shown in the third column of the table.If we wait longer, the return will be 15% and 8%respectively.Are these good returns?Well, keep in mind that by waiting,we are holding the project as an asset with its risks.We also know the cost of capital is10%, which is the return on similar assets in the market.Therefore, waiting is desirable onlyif it yields a return higher than the cost of capital.Column three shows that the return from waitingis higher than 10% until year three,while waiting from year three to year four is only 8%lower than the cost of capital.This gives us the optimal time to launch the project, whichis year three.Second, we can also compare by discountingthe FPV of different options backto year zero at the cost of capital of 10%.That is, to compare the NPV now.Column four gives the numbers.Clearly, launching in year three gives the highest NPV today.Other than being mutually exclusive,projects can be dependent in other ways, such as sequential.That is, project B is contingent on project A.For example, selling advertisementthrough a social network is contingent on buildingthe network first.Such a dependence is what we called strategic optionsearlier.We will return to this topic later in part twoafter developing a better understandingon options and effective tools to value them.

PROFESSOR: Although we have been advocating the NPVrule for capital budgeting decisions, in practice,other rules are also used.We can list some of the common ones--the payback period, internal rate of return,sometimes also called IRR, profitability index,sometimes also called PI, and so on.As is often the case, for the correct answer,there's only one, while for the not so correct answers,there are many.We will show a more extended list of these alternative rulesby the end of this lecture.Firms use these rules for various reasons.First, they were used historically,and habits die hard.Second, they may have worked in previous situations, oftencombined with common sense and other considerations.Third, under certain circumstances,they do give the same answer as NPV.But in general, they don't agree with NPV.Therefore, it is important to note that the NPV ruledominates these alternatives.Nonetheless, given their presence in practice,we will discuss some of these alternative rules,their validity, and limitations.The first rule we consider is based on the so-called paybackperiod of a project.A project's payback period is defined as the minimum time,denoted by s, such that the sum of net cashflows from the project turns positive.In other words, it is the time takenfor the sum of the projects' subsequent payoffsto just cover the initial investment.This is formally given by the equation highlightedon this slide.The capital budgeting rule based on the payback periodfirst specifies a threshold payback time--say, t star.Then for independent projects, accept all thosewith payback period not exceeding the threshold.For mutually exclusive projects, among the projectswith payback periods not exceeding the threshold,accept the one with the minimum payback period.Let's consider an example to illustrate this rule.Suppose that the payback threshold is three years,and we have two projects, 1 and 2.Their dollar cash flows are given in the table,in thousand dollars.Their payback periods are four and three years, respectively,as given in the last column in the table.This is easily seen.Take project one, for example.The initial investment is 100 in year zero.Positive payoff starts at 20 in year one, then 40 in year two,with the sum being 60; then 30 in year three,with the sum being 90; and then 10 in year four,with the sum being 100, which justequals the initial investment.Therefore, its payback period is four years.With the cutoff payback period being three,the firm will reject project one and accept project two.But looking at the two projects more carefully,and what the payback period does,it has two obvious shortcomings.First, the rule ignores cash flowsafter that payback period.For example, project one has substantial cash flowsin year five and six which are totallyignored in the decision.Second, the rule ignores discounting.Both of these omissions can lead to deviationsfrom the optimal decision.To see this, let's assume that the proper discountrate is 10% for both projects.We can then compute their NPVs.In particular, project one has an NPV of roughly $39,000,while project two has an NPV of roughly minus $7,000.But by the payback rule, project twowas accepted, not project 1.One can think of possible fixes to overcomethe rule's shortcomings.For example, incorporating proper discounting,one can define the discounted payback periodas the time it takes for the sum of the discounted cash flowfirst exceeds the initial investment.This is better than before, but still ignores the cash flowsafter the discounted payback period.

PROFESSOR: The next rule we consideris based on the internal rate of return, or IRR.A project's IRR is defined as the numberthat gives a zero if used to discountall the project's cash flows.Mathematically, it is defined by the equation on this slide.Clearly, IRR, if it exists, is solelydetermined by the project's cash flow.We don't need any other information.The decision rule based on IRR is as follows.First, a threshold rate or a hurdle rate, IRR star, is set.Then, for independent projects, acceptall the projects with IRR greaterthan the hurdle rate, IRR star.For mutually exclusive projects, among the projects with IRRsgreater than the hurdle rate, acceptthe one with the highest IRR.Let's consider an example to illustrate the use of IRR rule.Again, consider two projects, 1 and 2, with cash flowsgiven in the table on the slide.These are the same two projects consideredfor the payback rule.We can find their IRRs through numerical solutions.As it turns out, project 1 has an IRR of 21%,and project 2 has an IRR of 7%.At a hurdle rate of 10%, say, only project 1will be accepted.This is the same choice as from the NPV rule as we saw earlier.Although IRR is widely used in practice,there's no guarantee that it gives the right answer.The IRR rule leads to the same decision as the NPV rulewhen the following conditions are met.First, cash outflow occurs only at time 0.Or more generally, cash flow changes side only once.Second, only one project is under consideration.Using IRR to rank projects is problematic,as we'll see in a minute.Third, opportunity cost of capitalis the same for all periods.From the definition of IRR, It isused to discount cash flows for all different periods.As we said before, in general, cash flows at different timesshould be discounted at different rates,according to their timing and risk.Fourth, the hurdle rate is set to be the sameas the cost of capital.Since IRR is determined solely by a project's cash flow,some people argue that it is easy to usebecause it requires no finance expertise, whichis about discount rates.But this is not quite right.Even with IRR, the rule relies on the right hurdle rate.Given the popularity of IRR rule in practice,we want to point out some potential issues in its use.We start from the more technical ones,and then move on to the more serious ones.First, given the project's cash flow,there may not exist an IRR.Sometimes there may be more than one IRR.We show this with two examples.The table on the top left of the slidegives the cash flow of a project.The figure on the top right plotsthe discounted value of the cash flow at an arbitrary discountrate, r.An IRR is given by the point wherethe cash flow's discounted value curve crosses the x-axis.Clearly, in this case the curve never reachesthe x-axis, implying no solution for the IRR.The table on the bottom left gives another cash flowand the figure on the right plots the cash flow'sdiscounted value curve.Here, the curve crosses the x-axis at two places.One is between 0 and 0.05, and another between 0.1 and 0.15.Which one should we pick, then, in this case?No obvious answer.Obviously, in these two cases the project's cash flowchanges side twice, violating one of the conditions neededfor IRR to work.Next, we show that IRR cannot be used to rank projects whenchoosing between them.We show this with an example.The example describes two projects, 1 and 2.The cash flows are given in the table on the slide,in row 2 and 3.Column 3 gives their IRRs 100% and 80%, respectively.Suppose the hurdle rate is 10% the costof capital for these projects.Then both projects pass the hurdle.If they are mutually independent, we will do both.However, if these two projects are mutually exclusive,we have to choose one between them.Clearly, then, project 1 wins because it has a higher IRR.If we compute their NPVs at the cost of capitalof 10%, which I give it in the last column in the table, thenproject 2 should be taken because it has a higher NPV.What's going on here?Well, if we look at the two cash flows more carefully,we'll notice that project 2 is a bigger project with larger cashflows.Even though it has a smaller IRR,its larger scale leads to a larger NPV.Given that we want to maximize the total market value,project 2 clearly delivers more.What we learn is that IRR, being a rate itself,does not capture the scale of the project.Therefore, you will miss the scale factorwhen it's used to rank projects whichmay well have different scales.

#### 415-1x_Lec_10-8_05-en

PROFESSOR: The last rule we're going to consideris based on a project measure calledprofitability index, or PI.The PI of a project is defined as the ratiobetween the present value of its future cash flowsby its initial investment.Formally, it's given by the equation on this slide.The decision rule based on PI is as follows.For independent projects, accept all with PI greater than 1.For mutually exclusive projects, among thosewith PI greater than 1, choose the one with the highest PI.However, PI suffers the same drawback as IRRin comparing projects with different scales.In fact, by normalizing the present value of future cashflows by the initial investment, PIis intent at removing the scale factor.Obviously, scale matters for value creation.More is better.The example on the slide further illustrates this point.For the sake of time, we will skip it here.But you are more than welcome to go over it yourself.To wrap up our discussion on the alternative rules in capitalbudgeting, we briefly present the resultsfrom a survey of CFOs from a broad set of companies.The figure on the slide shows the percentageof CFOs surveyed who use a particular capital budgetingrule.The y-axis lists the rules used, and the x-axisgives the percentage of CFOs always or mostlyalways use that rule.Here a few observations from the data.First, there's a long list of rules being used.We live in the rich world.Second, NPV and IRR are on top of the list in terms of usage.It is indeed the case that IRR hasbeen around longer than NPV.Payback is quite popular as well, despite its drawbacks.And PI is on the list too, but towards the bottom,despite its wider validity, except for comparing projects.Third, if we add up the percentageof all the rules on the list, it way exceeds 100%.This means that multiple rules are oftenused at the same time.There could be a range of possibilitiesfor why this is the case.At one end, don't know which one to use and justthrow a bunch at it.At the other end, use several rules to complement each otherand to arrive at a more robust answer.Hopefully, the latter is more often the case.

PROFESSOR: Before we finish our introductory discussionon capital budgeting, there are a few additional pointswe would like to make.The first point is our cash flow forecasts.The precision of these forecasts is less of a concern,except that it may reflect the risk of future cash flows.What is more important is to do our bestto avoid any systematic biases in the forecasts.Leaving aside intended biases managers may have,there can be honest mistakes or missed factors.One example is the response of competitors.If a project is very profitable, such as a new productor a new business model, it is easy to think that the profitwill continue for a while.But the fact is a more profitable projectwill more likely attract imitators.They will cut into the project's future cash flows.Underestimating future competitioncan lead to overly optimistic cash flow forecasts.Next, in our analysis, we have saidthat a firm should take on all the independent projectswith positive NPVs.This requires that the firm does not face any constraintsin doing so.One possible constraint is the amount of capital available.With a well-functioning market, this should not be a problem.The firm can always raise capitalif it has good projects also recognized by the market.In reality, however, there could be deviations.Since large public companies have easy accessto the financial market, capital is rarelya constraint, except in unusual circumstances,such as severe information asymmetry or financial crisis.For small firms, the access to financial market can be costly.This may impose a soft constrainton capital, therefore, the firm's abilityto take on more projects.But the truth of the matter is that good projectsare more scarce than capital.There are, however, situations in which capitalconstraint can be more real.One example is capital allocation within a firm.A division inside a firm does not have direct accessto the financial market.Its capital is often provided by the firm's headquarters.At a given time, the division may onlyhave a fixed amount of capital at its disposal.Such a situation is also called capital rationing.What do we do, then, with capital rationing?The answer is fairly straightforward.Let's think this over.Suppose that we have N independent projects.They all have positive NPVs.For each project I, let its initial investmentbe I subscript I, its NPV be NPV subscript I, whichis assumed to be positive.Let the total amount of capital availablebe capital I. What we should do isto choose the set of projects suchthat first the total investment is no greater than capitalI, the total amount of capital allocated to us, and two,maximizes the total NPV.The last point we want to make is a more general one.Our analysis focuses on the computationof a project's NPV given its cash flow forecastsand the discount rates.We did not talk about where these projects come from.Presumably, they come from the business opportunitiesthe firm explores-- that is, the real side of the firm.What finance does is to evaluate them when they show up.If we find positive NPV for a project,it will be a bit too simplistic to just go aheadwith the number.There are additional questions we should ask.For example, are our assumptions reasonable?How robust is our answer?But more importantly, we should think hard about wherethe project's value comes from.For example, is it from the firm's short-run competitiveadvantage--for example, at the right place and the right time--or is it form long-term competitive advantage,such as pattern, technology, brand, economy of scale,et cetera?Or is it just noise, like pure luck, such as finding $100 billon the sidewalk?It's a positive NPV project to pick it up,but you're probably not going to be spending a lot of timeon the sidewalk hoping to find another $100 bill.Our analysis will be more complete and reliableif we know better about the source of valuefrom a positive NPV project.Just having a positive number for NPVwithout knowing what is behind itis far from being sufficient.

PROFESSOR: Now is year zero.You're considering opening a new concept restaurant.Last year, you have hired a consulting companyto help you evaluate your business idea.The consulting company charged you $125,000,and turned in the following operating projectionsfor the next 10 years.Annual revenue is expected to be $270,000,and will start in year one.Annual expenses will also start in year one,and are expected to be $130,000.In year zero, you will make capital investments,which primarily include restaurant equipment,totaling $650,000.This equipment will be depreciatedusing straight line depreciation method over the next 10 years.The appropriate cost of capital is 10%.And the current tax rate is 21%.Your goal is to determine whether you shouldopen this restaurant or not.Let's solve this question.We are asked to evaluate whether weshould open the new restaurant.To make this decision, we should use the net present valuerule, which states that we shouldinvest if the net present value is positive.The net present value is defined as the sum of project's cashflows discounted to present using appropriate discountrates.Therefore, to compute the net present value,we first should compute project's cash flows.Cash flows are defined as 1 minus tax rate times operatingprofit minus capital expenditures plus tax ratetimes depreciation minus change in working capital.Tax rate times depreciation is known as the depreciation taxshield, which arises due to the factthat depreciation is a tax deductible expense.Notice that in this question we are notgiven any information regarding working capital requirementsof running the restaurant.Therefore, we will assume that changes in the working capitalare zero.In this case, cash flows can be computedas 1 minus tax rate times operating profit minus capitalexpenditures plus depreciation tax shield.Let's record all of the given informationinto the spreadsheet and use it to computethe net present value of this project.Consulting fees of $125,000.Annual revenue is $270,000.Expenses are $130,000.And capital expenditures, which I abbreviate here as CapEx,are $650,000.Tax rate is 21%.Cost of capital is 10%.The question tells us that the restaurant will startgenerating revenue in year one.And this revenue will continue every year from year oneuntil year 10.Expenses also start in year one.And similar to revenue, they continue all the waythrough year 10.Now, knowing revenue and expenses,we can compute operating profit, whichequals to the difference between revenue and expenses.So therefore, every year from year onethrough year 10 operating profit equals to $140,000.Now, next, we need to compute annual depreciation expense.The question tells us that capital assetswill be depreciated using straight line depreciationmethod over the next 10 years.So therefore, to compute the annual depreciation expense,we're taking capital expenditure,and we're dividing it by 10.So therefore, every year, depreciation expensewould equal to $65,000.Capital expenditures occur only in year zero.That's when we buy restaurant equipment.Now, knowing operating profit, depreciation capitalexpenditure, we can compute after tax cash flow.Recall that by definition of the tax cash flow equal to 1minus tax rate, which is 21% in this case, multipliedby operating profits minus capitalexpenditure plus depreciation tax shield,which equals to the tax rate multiplied by depreciationexpense.And so in year zero, after tax cash flowequals to negative $650,000.In all the subsequent years, in year one through year 10,after tax cash flow equals to $124,250.Now, the final step to compute the net present value,we need to discount all of these cash flows to present.To discount these cash flows to present,we're taking the cash flow, and we're dividing itby 1 plus cost of capital raised to the power whichequals to the year when this cash flow occurs.So these are the discounted cash flows.And the net present value simply equals to the sumof the discounted cash flows.So the net present value here equals to $113,462.Now, what about consulting fees?Since we paid these fees last year, they are sunk.And we should not take them into accountwhen making our decision whether to open the restaurant or not.Since the net present value is positive $113,462,we should go ahead and open the restaurant.Now, let me also teach you how to usethe NPV function in Excel to directly computethe net present value.The function NPV takes the first argumentas the discount rate, which in our caseis the cost of capital.And the values are all of the cash flowsthat start from year one onwards.So remember, because we're using NPV function,we're just taking the cash flows that are not discounted.So the function will discount these cash flows for us.If we also subtract the initial investment of $650,000,this calculation should equal to the net present value, whichwe computed by just summing up the cash flowsthat we discounted ourselves.So the two results are identical.You might have thought of a more compact wayof solving this problem.Since every year, starting in year oneand ending in year 10, revenue, expenses, and depreciationexpense are constant, after-tax cash flowshave to be constant as well.They equal to 1 minus tax rate, whichis 21%, times operating profit, whichis $140,000, plus depreciation tax shield, which altogetherequals to $124,250.We can compute the present value of these cash flowsfrom year one through year 10 using the annuity formulaas follows.$124,250 divided by 10%, which is our cost of capital,multiplied by 1 minus 1 divided by 1 plus 10%,again, our cost of capital, raised to the power of 10,which equals the number of periods.This equals to $763,462.Given the initial investment of $650,000,the net present value equals to $113,462, exactly the numberthat we obtained before.Notice how much faster we were able to solve thisquestion by utilizing the annuity formula.Keep this in mind and use this approach whenever possible,especially on the exam.

PROFESSOR: Cyber Vision, a computer vision startupin Cambridge, Massachusetts, considersopening a new division to explore the viabilityof a new technology.To evaluate its decision, Cyber Visionfirst needs to forecast working capitalneeds for the new division.Its Chief Financial Officer developedthe following projections in thousands of dollars.Accounts receivable are expected to be $0, $50,000, $60,000,and $75,000 in years zero, one, two, and three respectively.Inventory is expected to be at $120,000, $150,000, $200,000,and another $200,000 in years zero, one, two,and three respectively.Accounts payable are expected to be $40,000, $40,000, $80,000,$100,000 in years zero, one, two, and three respectively.Calculate the cash flows associatedwith changes in working capital for the first three yearsof this investment.This question is designed to helpus understand the impact of working capitalrequirements on cash flow.First, let's use forecasts of accounts receivable, inventory,and accounts payable to compute net workingcapital in each year.By definition, net working capitalequals to accounts receivable plus inventory minus accountspayable, therefore in year zero, net working capitalwill equal to $0 plus $120,000 minus $40,000 or $80,000.In subsequent years, in years one, two, and three,net working capital will equal $160,000, $180,000 and $175,000respectively.Now, recall that it's not the net working capital itself,but rather changes in net working capitalis what affects the cash flow, so let's computeincreases in net working capital each year.In year zero, this increase is just$80 because we go from up $0 up to $80,000.In the year one, this increase willequal to $160,000, which is the level of net workingcapital in year one minus $80, whichwas the level of net working capital in the year zero,so this is the increase of another $80,000.In year two, net working capital increases by $20,000,from $160,000 to $180,000 and in year three decreases by $5,000,from $180,000 down to $175,000.Now, the final step is to computethe associated impact of increasesin net working capital on cash flow.Recall that, by definition, cash flow equals to 1 minus tax ratetimes operating profit minus capitalexpenditures plus depreciation tax shield minus changein net working capital, therefore the cash flowwill be of the opposite sign from increasesin net working capital.So in year zero, cash flow is going to be equalto negative $80,000.In year one, it will also equal to negative $80,000.In year two, it will equal to negative $20,000,and in year three, it is going to equal to positive $5,000.Now let's try to understand the intuition here.Why in year one we have a cash outflow of $80,000?Well, let's look at the componentsof net working capital.Accounts payable don't change.They remain at $40,000.But accounts receivable go up from $0 to $50,000,and inventory goes up from $120,000 to $150,000,therefore it's this build-up in the receivablesand the inventory that causes an outflow of $80,000 in year one.

PROFESSOR: Let's reconsider the restaurant projectwe studied in question one.Suppose that to run the restaurantyou need $190,000 each year in net working capital.This working capital consists of food and beverage stockand the associated supply chain neededto produce and serve meals.You're required to make this investment in the year zero.In the year 10, you expect to closethe restaurant, at which point the net working capital willgo down to $0.Does this change your decision onwhether you should open this restaurant or not?Let's set net working capital requirements to the restaurantproject we considered in question one.To run this restaurant, we're requiredto have $190,000 in net working capital each year,starting in the year zero and ending in year nine.In year zero, we will close the restaurant,and the working capital will go down to zero.Let's start by adding these requirements to line sixin the spreadsheet.In year zero, we're required to have $190,000in net working capital.These requirements are the same all the way through year nine,and in the year 10, since we're closing down the restaurant,the working capital goes down to $0.Next, we compute the year-over-year changesin net working capital.So in year zero-- we'll assume that before year zerowe had nothing in net working capital,so therefore, since the requirements in year zeroare $190,000, our increase is $190,000 in year zero.In subsequent years, we're computing the increasesby taking the difference between this yearand the previous year, so for example, in year one,the increase in net working capitalis $0 because the net working capitalrequirements are the same in the year zero and the year one.So the increase will be $0 all the way through year nine,and in the year 10, the working capitalis going to decrease by $190,000 because the net working capitalrequirements in the year 10 are $0.And in the year nine, they were $190,000,so therefore the net working capitaldecreased by $190,000 between the year nine and 10.Now in line eight, I will use the definitionof after-tax cash flow to compute after-tax cash flowsevery year.By definition, it is 1 minus tax rate--recall that the tax rate is 21%--multiplied by operating profit minus capital expendituresplus depreciation tax shield, which is computed by tax ratemultiplied by depreciation expense minus increasein net working capital.And so in year zero, the cash flows are negative $840,000.In all of the subsequent years, theseare the after-tax cash flows.Note that in years one through year ninethe after-tax cash flows are exactly the sameas we had in question one.In the year 10, however, the after-tax cash flowis higher by $190,000, so this isthe amount of the decrease in net working capital.As the final step, I will compute the net present valueof this restaurant project, and we'll use the NPV function.I used the cost of capital, cash flows from year onethrough year 10, and I'm adding up the after-tax cashflow in year zero.And the net present value is negative $3,284.Turns out, net working capital requirementsmake the NPV of this project negative,and therefore we should not open this restaurant.Conceptually, it is the timing of cash flows associatedwith the working capital that makessuch a significant difference in this case.We're required to spend additional $190,000in year zero, which we only get back in year 10.Given the discount rate of 10%, the time value of $190,000is significant enough to turn the NPV of this projectnegative.

PROFESSOR: You're considering a projectthat requires immediate investmentin year zero of $37,000.You expect that it will generate $20,000 in year one,$15,000 in year two, $10,000 in year three,and $2,500 in year four.The first question asks, what is the payback periodof this project?Well, let's solve this question.By definition, the payback periodis the amount of time it takes to pay backthe initial investment.In our case, the initial investment is $37,000.In the first year, the project returns$20,000, which is less than the initial investment.Therefore, this project does not pay back our initial investmentwithin one year.In the second year, the project returns $15,000.Therefore, during the first two years,the project returns 20,000 plus 15,000,which equals to $35,000.This is still less than $37,000, whichmeans that the project does not pay back the initial investmentwithin the first two years.In the third year, the project pays off $10,000.Therefore, during the first three yearsof life of this project, it returns 20,000 plus 15,000plus $10,000.Altogether, this equals $45,000.Now, this is more than the initial investment of $37,000.Therefore, the payback period of this projectis three years because it pays back our initial investmentwithin the first three years.The second question asks if you requirea payback period of two years, will you take this project?Let's solve this question.If you follow a payback period rule,then you only take projects that pay backwithin two years of initial investment.In part a, we computed the payback period of the projectunder consideration.This payback period was three years.Since this project pays back within three years,and you only take projects that pay back within two years,you will not take this project.Third question-- what is the net present value of this projectif the cost of capital is 12%?According to the net present value rule,should you take this project?If the cost of capital is 12%, the NPV of this projectis as follows.Negative $37,000, which is the initial investment,plus $20,000 that we receive in year one discounted to present.Plus $15,000 that we receive in the year twodiscounted to present.Plus $10,000 we receive in year three discounted to present.And finally, $2,500 received in year fourdiscounted to present.Altogether, this equals to $1,521.65.Since the net present value of this project is positive,we should take this project.Now, let us pause and think.Payback period rule tells us not to take this project,while the net present value rule says that weshould take this project.Recall that following the net present value ruleis always optimal because it increasesthe value of the firm.Therefore, by following the payback period rulein this case, we would have made the wrong decisionand would not have increased firm value.Let us summarize this lesson.Payback period rule can lead to wrong investment decisions.This happens because, one, payback period rule relieson ad hoc decision criterion.Why we decided to take projects with payback period of twoyears or less and not three years or four years?Who have made this decision?There are clearly no good a priorireasons for this decision.Two, payback period rule ignores cash flows thatoccur after the payback period.In our case, this project returns $10,000 in year threeand $2,500 in year four.By following the payback period rulewe carve off two years while ignoring these cash flows.As shown by NPV calculation, these cashflows clearly make a difference in this casebecause the net present value of this project is positive.And three, payback period rule ignores project's costof capital and time value of money.

PROFESSOR: Consider a project thatrequires an investment of $30,000 in Year 0.This project is expected to generatecash flows of $4,600 over the next 10 years.What is the internal rate of return, or IRR,of this project?First, let's learn how to build an NPV profile for a givenproject.By definition, NPV profile is a graphof a project's NPV over a range of discount rates.In our case, if the discount rate is r,the net present value of this projectis negative $30,000, which is the initial investment,plus $4,600 divided by r, multiplied by 1 minus 1divided by 1 plus r raised to the power 10.Here we are using the formula thatcomputes the present value of an annuity thatpays $4,600 each year for 10 years starting in Year 1.Now let's use Excel to compute this NPV for a rangeof discount rates, r.In the spreadsheet, I have built in an array of discount ratesstarting from 0.25% all the way to 15% with incrementsof a quarter of a percent.Now, for each of these discount rates,I will compute the net present value of our project.So starting for 0.25%, the net present valueequals to the initial investment plus annual cash flow dividedby this discount rate multiplied by 1 minus 1 divided by 1plus discount rate raised to the power 10.So in this case, if the discount rate is 0.25%,the net present value of our project is $15,374.Now, let me fix the cells, B3 and B4,so that I can stretch this array all the way down.And it'll automatically compute the net present valueof this project for all of these discount rates.Now, recall that by definition, NPV profileis a graph of a project's NPV for a range of discount rates.So let's plot NPV against discount rates.I am going to select both arrays and build this graph.What we see is that for this project,the NPV profile is a convex downward-sloping line.It intersects x-axis around 8.75% mark.Recall that by definition, the internal rate of return,or IRR, is the discount rate that makes NPV of the projectequal to 0.Therefore, the major benefit of building the NPV profileis to gauge what the internal rate of return for a givenproject is.In our case, internal rate of returnis somewhere around 8.75%.Note that this is not the exact solution yet.We will learn two ways of findingthe exact solution for the internal rate of return now.The first method of finding the internal rate of returnis to use Goal Seek function in Excel.This function numerically solves equations.To use this function, we need to computethe net present value of project for any given discount rate.This initial discount rate is often referred toas an initial guess.So I will set it 0.25%.And let's compute the net present valuefor this initial guess.Net present value equals to the initial investment amountplus the annual cash flow dividedby the initial guess multiplied by 1 minus 1 divided by 1plus the discount rate raised to the power 10.So if the discount rate is 0.25%,the NPV is $15,374, same as we had before.Now, let's use Goal Seek function.We're going to Data tab, What-If Analysis, Goal Seek.Goal Seek allows us to vary or to find the discount rate thatwould set the net present value to any value that we want.Now, since we are trying to find internal rate of return,we want to set this cell, D9, where the NPV isto 0 by changing this cell.So we want to find the net present value thatwould equal to 0 by changing the initial guess that weset for a discount rate.When we press OK button, Excel solves this equationand finds the discount rate that sets the NPV of this projectto 0.In this case, the discount rate that sets NPV to 0is 8.64%, which, by definition, is the internal rate of returnof this project.Goal Seek function is a useful tool thatallows you to solve any nonlinear equation in Excel.The second method that we'll learnhow to find internal rate of returnjust simply utilizes the IRR function in Excel.Through this function, we need to enter all cash flowsthat our project generates.We'll start with the Year 0 wherewe have the outflow of $30,000.And then for the subsequent years, from Year 1until Year 10, our project returns $4,600 every year.Now, in this area, we have all of the cash flowsthat this project generates.To find its internal rate of return, we use IRR function.So we type IRR.And then we simply select the entire array in whichwe have our cash flows.There is a second parameter that isrequired for the IRR function.It's an optional parameter.In some complicated cases, it does matter.In our case, it does not.We can put 0 here and hit Enter.This function tells us the internal rateof return of this project is 8.64%,the same IRR that we got from using Goal Seek function.The second part of this question asks,if the cost of capital for this project is 9%,should you take it?We have found that the internal rate of return of this projectis 8.64%.Now, let's recall the IRR rule, whichstates we should invest only if the internal rate of returnof a project is higher than its cost of capital.In our case, the internal rate of return of 8.64%is less than 9%, which is the cost of capitalfor this project.Therefore, we should not take it.To confirm, let us also compute the net present valueof this project given its cost of capital.If the cost of capital is 9%, the NPV of this projectis negative $479.NPV of this project is negative.Therefore, we should not take it.Both IRR and NPV investment decision rules in this caseagree.

PROFESSOR: Rio Tinto is considering the developmentof a bauxite mine.Development costs are estimated to be $24 million in year zero.The mine will generate 4 million in cash flowsover the next 10 years, starting in year 1and ending in year 10.After that, Rio Tinto is planning to close the mineand to bring the site in compliancewith environmental laws.The estimated costs of closing and complianceare expected to be $350,000 per year starting in year 11and continuing in perpetuity.Assume that the cost of capital is 8%.The first question asks find the internal rateof return of this project.Should you invest in this project based on the IRR rule?Let's start by entering given informationinto the spreadsheet.In year 0 we have to spend $24 million to develop the mine.In years 1 through 10, the mine will generate $4 millionper year.Starting in year 11 we have to spend $350,000 or 0.35 millionper year in compliance costs.First, let's write down the NPV of this project as a functionof discount rate r.It equals to negative 24 million,which is the initial investment, plus the second term, whichcaptures present value of positive cash flowsthat the project generates in years 1 through 10.This is a simple annuity that pays 4 millioneach year for 10 years.The last term captures compliance costs,it is a perpetuity that starts in year 11.We can use the perpetuity formulato find its value in year 10, which is 0.35 divided by rand then we discount this value to present.Now to find the internal rate of returnwe need to set this NPV to 0 and solve this equation for r.Now obviously we cannot do this by hand because this isa linear equation of high dimension.We also cannot use IRR formula that we used in previousquestion because we're dealing with perpetuity and thereforecannot enter the entire stream of cash flows into an array.In other words, we just cannot enter an infinite array herein Excel.Therefore we need to utilize Goal Seek tool.Let's start with initial guess for IRR, say 1%.Given this 1% I will compute the net present valueof this project.I will break down this calculationinto three parts, the initial investment, the annuity partand the perpetuity part.The initial investment simply equals to negative 24 million.The annuity part equals to 4, dividedby r, multiplied by 1 minus 1, divided by 1 plus r,raised to the power 10.And the perpetuity part equals to 0.35, divided by r,and this entire expression is divided or discountedto present at discount rate r.Now the NPV of the project is the sumof these three components.Now to find the internal rate of return,I go to Data, What If Analysis, Goal Seek, so Iset the cell or the NPV to 0, rememberthat internal rate of return is the discount rater that sets this NPV to 0, by changingthe cell of our initial guess.So Excel solves this for us and gives usthe solution that the internal rate of return for this projectequals to 2.48%.Now given that the cost of capital is 8%and the internal rate of return isless than the cost of capital, the conventional internal rateof return rule would imply that we should nottake this project.The second part of this question asksus to find the net present value and askswhether we should invest in this project based on the NPV rule.Well the NPV of this project is simply this expression,it is the same expression that we justused to find internal rate of returnbut here we're just using the cost of capital of 8%.Turns out that the net present value of this projectis $814,000, therefore Rio Tinto should go aheadwith this project.This contradicts the answer that wereceived based on the internal rate of return rule.So what gives?To understand what's going on let'sbuild an NPV profile of this project.I have created an array of discount rates from 2% to 15%in quarter of a percent increments.For each of these discount rates let'scompute the net present value.I'm using here the same formula as the one we just used.I will extend this array which will automaticallycompute the net present value for all discount ratesthat we have here.Now what we see on the graph is the NPV profileof this project.Recall that in question 5 NPV profile was a decreasingfunction of discount rates.What we see here is a very different picture,NPV profile is first increasing and then decreasingin discount rates.We visually see that when discount rate is8%, which is our cost of capital,the net present value of this project is positiveand therefore we should take this project.To understand why IRR rule gave us the wrong investment advicerecall the following, IRR rule can be used onlywhen cash outflow occurs only in time 0,only one project is under consideration,opportunity cost of capital is the same for all periodsand the threshold rate is set to the cost of capital.In our case, cash outflow occurs in year 0as well as from year 11 onwards.Therefore, we cannot use the internal rate of return ruleto make an investment decision in this case.Let me make another remark, the NPV profilehere shows that this project has two internal rates of return.The first one is somewhere between 2% and 3%and the second one is somewhere around 9%but when we used Goal Seek tool it gave us only one solution.The reason for this is the initial guess or the startingpoint.Our first initial starting point was1% and the numerical algorithm thatsolved this equation converged to the first solution here,which was 2.48%.But if we started from a different initial guessor initial starting point anywhere to the rightfrom this hump, say at 6%, we would haveconverged to the second IRR.To confirm this, let's go back to the other spreadsheetand use Goal Seek tool with the starting point of 6%.So in this initial guess cell I will put 6%and I will go back to Goal Seek tooland I will ask it to set the net present value of this projectto 0 by changing the discount rate cell.And if we solve this equation from a different startingpoint, we see that the algorithm hereconverged to this second internal rate of return,which is 9.04% in this case.The conclusion is that this project has two IRRsand we can find both of them using numerical tools in Excel.But what's more important is that we cannot use the internalrate of return rule to make the investment decision in thiscase because the conditions under which we can use the IRRrule are not satisfied, namely in this case,we have cash outflows that occur after year zero.In particular, the compliance costs that start in year 11and continue onwards.
