[indistinct chatter] ERIC: <i>It's a simple game.</i> You have 15 players. Give one of them the ball, get it into the net. CONNELL: Very simple. ‐ Isn't it? ‐ Oh, what? ‐ Oh. ‐ Brilliant. ERIC: How's it going, Rachel? Talking tactics, there, for the game. ‐ We're getting a master class. ‐ How incredibly boring of you. ‐ Yeah. Did you get your hair done? RACHEL: I did, yeah.

They don't look too impressed to me. ‐ I'm pretty sure I was just looking out the window. ‐ Come on, Sheridan. MR. KERRIGAN: If you're staring out the window daydreaming, then you're not learning, are you, Marianne? ‐ Don't hurt yourself. I have nothing to learn from you. [soft shocked laughter] ‐ Okay, in that case, principal's office. ‐ Yeah. I might go there. Or I might just head home. It's not really your business what I do, is it? ERIC: Don't worry, sir.

LORRAINE: I hear you did very well. ‐ He did. CONNELL: Yeah, well... Marianne did pretty good, too. Can we go? ‐ Didn't realize we were in a rush. Just put these away, and then we'll be off.

You're not heading home, no? ‐ I did actually get a detention. ‐ Sorry. ‐ Technically, I requested it. ‐ You were fairly harsh on Kerrigan the other day, as well. He's actually pretty decent.

It's just school. It's the same for everybody. It's not unique for you. ‐ You try to act like we're friends, but you know you're not that kind of person. ‐ I'm not acting. Maybe I am that kind of person. ‐ Why are you talking to me, then? ‐ Yeah. ‐ What was Ms. Neary talking to you about after class? ‐ Oh, don't know. Uh... getting out of class early for training or something. ‐ She must find training highly amusing, then. ‐ Well. ‐ Does she fancy you or something? ‐ Why'd you say that? ‐ God, you're not having an affair with her, are you? ‐ Please. You think it's funny joking about stuff like that, do you? ‐ Sorry. ‐ People going at me like I fancy her. I‐‐ I don't fancy her. ‐ Well... maybe it's because you blush a lot when she talks to you. ‐ Aah. ‐ But you know, you blush at everything. ‐ Thanks. ‐ Guess you have one of those complexions. ‐ Great. ‐ You're blushing right now, actually. ‐ Yeah. I'm aware. ‐ Sorry. I don't want to get into a fight with you or anything. ‐ [chuckles] We're not fighting. ‐ I know you... probably hate me.

He's probably very busy doing amateur drama or something. ‐ Debating. And you're being cruel. ‐ Ah, yeah, I clocked that. See, I thought I was bad going out with Rachel Moore, and your boyfriend's a Holocaust denier. ‐ [scoffs] He's just into free speech. Okay, so we both failed on ideological purity. ‐ Yeah. [laughs] ‐ Are you dating anyone problematic at the moment? ‐ No. Not even anyone good. ‐ Finding it hard to meet people here? ‐ Mm‐hmm. It's, uh... It's a bit different from home, I suppose. ‐ Mm. Probably why I'm good at it. I have some girlfriends I could introduce you to. ‐ Oh, yeah? ‐ Yeah. I have those now. [Connell chuckles] ‐ Ah, not sure I'd be their type. ‐ What do you mean? ‐ Ah, I don't know. ‐ What's not to like about you? ‐ That's a good question.

It's either true, or it's not. How do you put that aside? ‐ I don't. But understanding how we decide which facts are disseminated, how we assess different planes‐‐ ‐ So basically gravity is a social construct‐‐ TEACHING ASSISTANT: Sorry, um, excuse me, but Marianne was still speaking. Carry on, Marianne. ‐ This isn't about negating the existence of fact. Like, obviously, gravity is real. But it's still valuable for historians to study the development of discourses around gravity, so we can learn how knowledge is produced, and, and by whom, and within what structures. That's all. ‐ So he's bullshitting about how gravity isn't even real, and Marianne absolutely annihilated him. It's like a cat playing with food. ‐ I bet it was. ‐ I mean, no, it wasn't. The tutor had to step in so I could make my not very groundbreaking point. There was zero annihilation. ‐ You emasculated him, Marianne. He's gonna be your enemy for life.

I can't picture the two of you guys, uh... hanging out in school and stuff. ‐ Well, we didn't, really. ‐ Right. Yeah. That makes sense. Is he, like... ...smart? ‐ Well, he's smarter than me. ‐ Right. ‐ He's actually the smartest person I've ever met. ‐ Fair enough. We should probably get to the library. Yeah, I obviously have a lot of work to do to become... the smartest person you've ever met, so... [Marianne laughing] ‐ I don't think it's possible, yeah. ‐ Ah, do you not think? ‐ No. ‐ He's the smart person you've ever met? ‐ All right? ‐ Well, well.

LECTURER: So, rather than looking at modernism solely as a literary phenomenon, we can regard it as a historical process, enfolding within and along with other significant processes and developments of the 1910s and '20s. Thank you. Oh, a bit of housekeeping. Next week's lecture will be in the Jonathan Swift. [indistinct chattering] ‐ Hey. ‐ Hey. ‐ Could I read your Joyce essay? The one that you got that unprecedented, like, literally impossible mark in. ‐ Oh. Where'd you hear that? ‐ Talk of the year. People are competitive. ‐ Yeah. [Sadie laughs] Right. ‐ I'm going to the literary society later on. ‐ Oh, right. ‐ Yeah, they're looking for new members, actually. ‐ Ah, okay. ‐ You look really sweet when you're concentrating. You have a really cute serious face. ‐ God, I'm so distracted by this committee bullshit. There was another argument last night. Phil went off on Hannah, and I think she might resign. It's just... It's just so fucking boring, you know? ‐ I, I really need to finish this before class. ‐ Sure. It's fine. MARIANNE: What's it like? You're, like, this star. You're top of the class. ‐ [laughs softly] I don't know what you mean. ‐ Do you enjoy it? Being recognized like that? ‐ Ah. Don't think I'm brilliant or anything like that. ‐ Mm? ‐ No, I mean it. ‐ It's just... no one else does their reading properly. They literally show up to discuss a book that they haven't even read, and then they just bang on about it, like, with complete confidence. And then... people are fools. ‐ And that bothers you? [scoffs] ‐ I suppose it does a little bit. No, that's not even it. It's... [clears throat] What upsets me is it's... is that I... barely know what to say half the time, like... Like outside of this. Outside of work. Like... Like they don't have to go around and pretend, or... be anything other than themselves. You know? And I feel like I'm... walking around trying on a hundred different versions of myself. It's just not working, or... ‐ It doesn't seem like that. From the outside, I mean. ‐ Then I think about home, and... ...school, and fuck, I just... I can't connect this life and... and that life. It just... just doesn't fit. Huh. Hmm. Do your friends know about us? Just, like... what happened at school, or whatever? ‐ No. Joanna does. Sort of. But not the others. I don't think so. I mean, they may have picked up on something, but I never told them. ‐ And would you be embarrassed if they found out? That we were together in school, or whatever? ‐ Yeah. In some ways. ‐ Why? ‐ Because it was humiliating. ‐ You mean the way I treated ya? ‐ Yeah. And just the... [sighs] Just the fact that I put up with it. Did you ever think about asking me to the Debs? I know, it's such a stupid thing. But, uh, I'm curious whether you thought about it. ‐ Um... [clears throat] Uh, to be honest, uh, no. I wish that I did. Yeah. Would you have said yes? ‐ Yeah. [moans] Fuck's sake. ‐ I'm really sorry. Apparently everybody knew about us, anyway. ‐ Everyone knew what? ‐ That we were seeing each other. ‐ I didn't tell anyone, Connell, I swear to God. ‐ Ah, fuck, I know. That's not what I mean. I mean... My point is is that even if you had told people, it wouldn't have mattered. ‐ Were they horrible about it? ‐ No. [laughs softly] Believe it or not, no one even cared. I feel really guilty about all that stuff I said to you about, uh... how bad it would be if people found out. Like, obviously that was just... That was just what was going on in my head, and... There'd be no reason why anybody would care. I just... [Connell clears throat] I think I just suffered from anxiety with those sort of things. I don't know. It's... Yeah. I still think about it all the time. I still... think about why I acted in such a fucked up way, and I'm really sorry... Marianne, I... [Marianne sniffles, exhales] I really am sorry. ‐ I forgive you. ‐ Thank you. [birds chirping] ‐ What? MARIANNE: Sorry. GARETH: We're just... I thought we were going to a party. ‐ I'm sorry, I just, I... felt I had to say it. ‐ But we're good. I mean, this is good. Everyone says we're good together. ‐ I mean, that's not a reason‐‐ And do they? Does everyone really go around saying that? ‐ Yeah. ‐ Do people even care? ‐ Yeah. I think people care that their friends are happy, yeah. ‐ Look, I'm sorry. I just‐‐ I don't think this is working. It's not what I want anymore. ‐ Anymore. ‐ Yeah. ‐ So you did want this at some point. Wow. You are literally like a completely different person right now. ‐ Sorry. Are you sure you don't mind bringing me? ‐ Sure, I'm going there myself, aren't I? ‐ But, uh, you hadn't promised Teresa a lift? ‐ What are you drinking? ‐ Gin. ‐ And... ‐ Gin. [laughs] ‐ Right. MARIANNE: She was talking about you. ‐ Right. ‐ You guys fighting or something? ‐ Oh, are we fighting? That's insane. Did she say that? ‐ No. But she said you were seeing each other. ‐ And that means we're fighting, does it? ‐ So you are seeing each other. ‐ It's casual. ‐ That's exactly what she said. Did you agree between you that that's what you were gonna tell people? ‐ Not as such, I don't think. ‐ You have such a nice face. ‐ [chuckles] You're getting drunk. ‐ People have said that to me. That your face is nice. ‐ That's nice of them. ‐ I just broke up with Gareth. Like, an hour ago. Is that why you were drinking gin on gin? ‐ Didn't hurt that much. ‐ You all right? ‐ I think I'm just a fundamentally cold, unfeeling person. I feel absolutely fine. ‐ That's bullshit. ‐ We weren't meant to be. Wasn't a good fit. ‐ Feel like I could have told you that myself. ‐ Do you? Hmm. [indistinct chattering] MARIANNE: Hi. Sophie! ‐ Hi! ‐ I'll go find the fridge, all right? SOPHIE: You made it! ‐ Hi. [laughs] SOPHIE: You look so nice. ‐ Ooh, hi, hi, hi. JAMIE: Hi. How are you? MARIANNE: Fine, how are you? JAMIE: Yeah, good. ‐ [laughs] What are they, like‐‐ I might go and say hello, but I'll catch you in a bit. SOPHIE: Okay. ‐ Hey. Hi. ALL: Hi! Hello! ‐ You look fantastic.

PEGGY: You'd really think they'd jump at the idea of multiple partners. ‐ Generally, and I am generalizing... CONNELL: Mm. MARIANNE: Men seem more concerned with limiting the freedoms of women than in exercising their own. ‐ If I were a man, I would have three girlfriends. At least. ‐ I see the appeal, but it also sounds deeply stressful. PEGGY: What about you? CONNELL: What about me? ‐ Do you not fantasize about having multiple women at once? I thought that was a universal thing for men. ‐ Right. Well, uh, no. Not really. ‐ We could have a threesome, if you want. CONNELL: Sorry? ‐ The three of us could... ‐ [chuckles] Right. Uh... Right. Well, um, I haven't... wouldn't... wouldn't really be my cup of tea. ‐ I'm much too self‐conscious. PEGGY: Really? ‐ Yeah. MARIANNE: I'd die. Yeah. PEGGY: About what? Your looks?

I guess I have a sort of... unlovable... I have a coldness about me. ‐ I don't believe that. Is she cold with you? ‐ No. ‐ You're cool, but I wouldn't say you were cold, necessarily. ‐ I think, uh, cool implies a degree of cold. ‐ You just live up here too much. You need to be more in touch with your feelings. ‐ Maybe. [chuckles] ‐ Well. I won't intrude any longer. ‐ You're not intruding. PEGGY: I'll see you tomorrow. No, stay where you are. Stay where you are. MARIANNE: No, not at all. I'll show you out. ‐ Connell. CONNELL: See you, Peggy. [indistinct chattering] [door opens] [door closes] [Connell chuckles] MARIANNE: Ah, well.

I'm sorry. ‐ Connell, what's wrong? ‐ I don't know. I just felt a bit, uh... a bit weird. I don't know. Um... ‐ If I've done something to upset you, I'm really sorry. ‐ No. No, I, uh... I, I'm sorry.

So obviously, it's, um... It's a bit different being away from her. ‐ It sounds difficult. ‐ Mm‐hmm. I don't really click with a lot of people. I, I struggle with that, actually. ‐ Do you think that's a new problem? Or is it familiar to you? ‐ Mm. It's, uh, familiar. I would say, um... in school, I definitely felt that feeling of isolation or whatever. But um... People seem to like me. Everything, and... here, I don't think that, uh... people like me that much. Uh, like Rob, my friend who, uh... um, I wouldn't say that we clicked on a very deep level or anything. But, um, we were friends. And, uh... I wouldn't say that we had a lot in common in terms of interests or anything like that. Definitely not politically, if we ever really examined that. But, um... That stuff didn't really matter in school. 'Cause we were, we were in the same group of friends, so, you know? ‐ I understand that. ‐ And, uh, he... he did some stuff that I, uh... I wouldn't have been a fan of, in terms of, like with girls. But uh... We were 18, you know. We just, uh... we acted like idiots, and uh... I think... I felt a bit alienated with that stuff. And, uh... I think‐‐ I think I thought if I... moved here... I'd fit in better. I thought, um... I'd meet more like‐minded people but that just hasn't... um... [sobs] I left Carricklea thinking I could have a different life. But I... I hate it here and... I can never go back. Because those friendships are gone, and... and Rob is gone and I, I can't see him again. I can't get that life back. I'm sorry. [heavy breath] ‐ You don't need to apologize.

I feel like, uh... our friendship would be a lot easier if like... uh, certain things were different. ‐ If what was different? ‐ I don't know, I, um, things would be a lot less confusing if there weren't like this... other element of the relationship. ‐ When we were together in the first year of college, were you lonely then? ‐ No. You? ‐ No. I was frustrated sometimes, but not lonely. I'm never lonely when I'm with you. ‐ Yeah. That was kind of a perfect time in my life, to be honest. I don't think I was ever really happy before then. ‐ I really wanted you to kiss me last night. ‐ Oh. I wanted to kiss you as well, I guess. Uh...

You are my best friend, and I don't... don't want to lose that for any reason. ‐ Yeah. I know what you mean. ‐ And I don't want you to think that I'm... not being appreciative or anything because I think you have been... so supportive of me what with the depression and everything.
