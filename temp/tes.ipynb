I was generally trying to and I thought that human interactions, social systems are a pretty hopeless case. There's no way I'll But simple things like particles I might be able to work that out. In the foundations of physics, we work with a lot of mathematics and I know from my own experience that it's really, really hard to learn. And so I think for a the journal articles that we write in the foundations of physics But nevertheless, we're that a lot of people are interested in. So I kind of see it as my mission to communicate all this from the papers to people to make sense of the mathematics, especially when it comes My book \"Existential Physics\" picks up all the big questions in physics that the laws of nature can And that includes questions like whether physics has ruled out free will?

      " What is - Okay, so let's talk about the physics of dead grandmothers. The thing is, it's got nothing It's actually got something to do with Einstein's theory It's all about the reality of time. It's all about the question this moment, this now which whether this is of fundamental importance. Before Einstein, time was We all shared the same moment of time and we all had the same moment of now that we could all agree on. But then Einstein came and he said, well, it's not that simple. And the major reason for this is that the speed of light is finite and it's the same for all observers. Oh, and also nothing can go And this sounds like a like all this stuff but it has a truly which is fairly easy if you ask yourself whether you know if the screen in front of you So naively you would say, I mean, I'm holding it in my hand or I see it directly in front of me. But we just learned that and nothing can go faster So everything that you experience, you see it as it was a tiny little amount of time in the past. So how do you know that What do you even mean by now? So this is the problem that comes up in Einstein's And Einstein tried to in this new theory and he failed and he just came to conclude which we experience, is Every moment is now for someone somewhere. So imagine you're looking straight ahead and there's a train going say from the left to the right. And on the train, there's your friend, and let's call her Alice. And as you probably know, all velocities are relative. So you would say the train from the left to the right. But Alice would say, well, actually you are from the right to the left. Now let's also imagine, so there's a lot of that at the exact moment that Alice, who is standing in the is looking straight at you, there are light flashes going And the question is, did these light flashes So this is the question Now if you want to answer this question looking at the train, that's You can just forget about the train. There are those light flashes going off. They both come from sources that are the same distance from you. So of course you see You would say, yeah, sure, But how does the same thing So the light flashes go off, but while the light travels towards her, she's moving towards and away from the other. So the one path of the light is shorter and the other one is longer. So from Alice's perspective, the light flash from arrives earlier than So she would say, no, they did And now the important point this is relativity, so neither of them is right They both have an equally And what do we conclude from this? Well, we conclude from this that there is no unambiguous notion to define what happens now. It depends on the observer. So they're both right. And if you follow this then the outcome is that every moment could be now for someone. And that includes all moments in your past and it also includes all So this impossibility to define one notion of is called the relativity of simultaneity. And it's super important because it tells us that fundamentally, this experience of now that (light-hearted music) - \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " What - The mathematical framework to make sense of this absence of now and the finiteness of the speed of light, even though it's the same and also the relativity of simultaneity, is that he combined space with which is called space-time. And more specifically, that this entire space-time exists in the same sense at this present moment, because the present moment has then it's become known It just sits there in one In the block universe, the past, the present, and the There's just no way one particular time as special. So the past in which your exists the same way as The story about the block if you take into account which Einstein when he didn't know anything about. This is because in quantum mechanics, we have this peculiar which brings in an amount of randomness. So in quantum mechanics, the because it doesn't exist But the past still exists the same way as it does (light-hearted music) - \n",

      " How do the laws of nature preserve information? - There's another way to look at this idea that people who have sadly deceased do in some sense still exist. And it's because of the way that all the fundamental laws They don't destroy information. The only thing that they do is that they rearrange the matter and radiation and They just give you the rules for how to put them in different places with different velocities. But you can apply those And this means that you can in principle, if you had a really, really good computer, you could always find out So in this sense, information It can, however, become, for practical purposes, So if someone you knew dies, that you can no longer And that's because the information that made up their personality, it disperses into very subtle correlations in the remains of their body, which become entangled with And slowly, slowly, they that disperses throughout the solar system and eventually throughout But they can't get destroyed. With two exceptions. (light-hearted music) - \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " What are two cases where information could get destroyed? - There are two cases that where information might get destroyed that have so far not been resolved. One of them is the information We don't actually know And the other one is the in quantum mechanics, which The issue with black holes is it becomes irretrievable because everything that is hidden behind the event horizon and it doesn't get back out. Now you could say, well, a sign that the information got destroyed. It just means that you But you could also say, well, if I have a book and I then I can't retrieve it but that doesn't mean that And that was true about black But then along came Stephen Hawking and he said, well, you know what? Black holes don't just sit there forever. They're actually unstable near the black hole horizon and that creates radiation, which is now called Hawking radiation, which is entirely random and it carries away mass and And as a result of this, and eventually it's entirely gone. And the only thing you are left with is this huge amount of Hawking so there's no information in it. And all the information about in the first place, maybe some or stuff that fell in has been entirely destroyed. But a lot of physicists, me I have questioned whether this calculation It has a lot of shortcomings. The most obvious one is probably that we don't have a theory of space and time itself. So this is a long-standing problem in the foundations of physics which we've known of We somehow have to combine Einstein's theory of general relativity, which describes gravity, And this would be a that's what it's called, And this would in principle in this calculation of that falls into a black hole, but we can't do it because This is one of the reasons that Hawking's calculation and that ultimately, information also in the evaporation of black holes. But the case is not entirely settled. Hawking himself, interestingly enough, changed his mind about what's Originally he thought but later in his life, he became that grew out of string theory, which is one of the approaches to a theory of quantum gravity, which say that information The other possible process in which information could is the measurement process And the reason for this is a theory in which we can only make probabilistic predictions. And for this, we use a device, a mathematical device that's So we describe everything and from this, we deduce the probability of getting a particular outcome. So you could, for example, that tells you a particle goes to the left side of the and to the right side But then by the time you you know it's either left or So you have to update the wave function. It's sometimes also called the collapse or the reduction of the wave function, but it's all the same thing. And now the issue is if is that you measured the particle on the left side of the screen, you can't tell what the It could have been a 50-50 thing or it could have been an 80-20 or it could have been a 5-95 All of those possible And so the information about exactly what the wave function was gets destroyed in the measurement. The problem is that we that this actually describes what happens. There's a big controversy around it, exactly what are we to make out A lot of people, me included, think that this is just an approximation to what is actually going on. We're missing the ultimately and this underlying theory would actually preserve information again. But we don't know. So this is another possibility where information could But yeah, so leaving of black hole information where we're not entirely sure information seems to actually But of course, we know that it becomes throughout the universe. And so if someone you know dies, then you can no longer because you yourself are and you have no access to this But this is a very anthropomorphic thing. It's very tied to our own existence. And who knows what's going to happen in a billion years or something Maybe there'll be some which will also be spread out and this information will So I know it sounds crazy, but for all we know about the about Einstein's theories and about the way that it seems that our existence actually transcends the passage of time. There is something timeless that makes up us and everything I think that's a really that we get directly from studying the foundations of physics. And I have to admit that I to make intuitive sense of it. It's one way to look at the maths and say, okay, this is how it works. These are the conclusions that and the mathematics that we It's another thing entirely to make sense of this But as a physicist, I trust the process of knowledge discovery that comes from using and so I take this seriously.

      " Why - We have this big mystery in If you take the fundamental laws of nature the way that we have then they work the same way So we think that fundamentally, everything is made up of small particles. And for the present purposes, you can think of those particles as little balls bouncing off each other. So you have particles coming and they hit each other Now this kind of particles bouncing off each other interaction, you can run this forward in It'll look pretty much the same. You wouldn't be able to tell which direction is forward But the problem is we think us, walls, plants, and so on and so forth, is made of those particles But we don't experience our reality as being the same forward in People only get older, but not younger. Eggs break, but they don't unbreak. If we drop a pebble into water, we see the water splash We don't see pebbles springing It just doesn't happen. So where does it come from, if the laws work the same The answer to this question is that it's not just the but it's also how the individual Some configurations are And over the course of time what happens is that the configurations Another way to say this So what we mean by this is that things become more They break, but they don't unbreak. This just doesn't happen. This explains part of the reason for why the direction forward in time looks different than the because entropy only increases If we run the movie backward, and we can do this but it won't look the same. But this really only because okay, fine, so we've and this explains why the future but it brings up a new problem, because entropy can only increase if it was small to begin with. And indeed, the entropy in the beginning of the universe, otherwise we wouldn't be here today. And why did this happen? We have put a name to it. It's And it literally just says, well, the entropy in the beginning but we have no idea why that is the case. So we've answered part of the Our current theories just don't work if the entropy of the universe wasn't small in the beginning. There are some contributions which we understand really badly, in particular, the contribution Again, there's this big issue for the quantum properties of gravity, and that would somehow have to count towards the entropy of the early universe. But we don't know how to do this. So the way that we deal with is that we just assume the at the beginning was small, But it's not that we There's no quantity that (light-hearted music) - \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " Is there any way to slow down the increase of entropy? - So despite the having this symmetry between forward in time we ourselves have this experience that forward in time is very different from backward in time. And this experience is what and we need an explanation for it. And the most common explanation that physicists put forward So what does the arrow of time and the second law of thermodynamics have to do with us aging? So at first sight you could say, well, that's all about biology. It's all about cell processes. And there are lots of scientists to slow down the process of aging and now you physicists come and try to tell them So it's certainly true that that determine how we age and it's really, really complicated, and I admit that I'm totally I'm just a physicist. But ultimately, what it goes back to, where all of this comes from, So it is possible to for some amount of time in a For example, there are certain creatures, like certain types of that can keep entropy increase very low for a certain amount of time on the expense of increasing And some species are And maybe we'll be able Maybe we'll be able to live or maybe a billion years. But eventually entropy This question of why we do and where does it come from and is there anything we can do about it has captured the imagination of a lot of science fiction writers. The most famous example In his short story \"The Last Question,\" Isaac Asimov envisions a man asking a computer, today we might say if there's any way to stop the entropy from increasing in the universe. And for a long time, billions of years, the answer of this computer, and its more sophisticated later versions, is that it has incomplete And at the very end, when and everything has and there's just radiation and the only beings that remain are completely disembodied consciousnesses that float through the universe, the computer finishes the calculation and says, let there be light. So this brings up the question, is this the last word on the issue? Is this it? This is how the universe will end. Entropy will increase and will increase, and in the end, nothing We're all in thermal equilibrium and nothing and no one will be alive. Well, this entire argument hinges on us understanding And as I said earlier, we don't really understand So if we don't understand we don't actually know what's going to happen with the universe. It might be much more So for me, the answer (light-hearted music) - \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      " Is the - Particle physicists have in what's called the Standard And those 25 particles, make up everything around us, the entire universe, including us. And so in principle, what we are is just a big collection of elementary particles. And yes, it's a really complicated one, and no one in their right mind would try to describe a human being in terms of those elementary particles. It would be entirely useless. But for all we currently Now a lot of people seem to be a little bit They are wondering, isn't Am I not a little bit more than just those fundamental particles? Where does my sense of identity come from? Where's my consciousness come from? Whatever happened to my soul? There's nothing like a soul in the Standard Model of particle physics. So whatever happened to that? Well, so personally, I don't think that to and that includes our our experience of us thinking, requires anything more I don't think particle physics I'm happy to leave the to neurobiologists or whatever I'm actually not entirely sure. So this is all well and fine. But I also don't think that to the fundamental laws of nature that we have collected in physics. I think it's sufficient. And a lot of people have They want there to be something else, this thing that they call the soul. And one possible route that you can take is what's called dualism that just says, where we have the world of physics, which is where we have all and atoms and gravity and interactions and all that kind of stuff. And on the other side, we have the soul. And it just lives in an And this is where I reside, in some sense. And this is perfectly fine. It's compatible with all we does not interact with the physical side. Because once it starts then you can observe its effects, If we would observe them, they would have to be part of our theories in the foundations of physics. So for all we currently know from the foundations of physics, everything that isn't of particle physics from those particles and And by emergent I just it can be derived from it, or it can be reduced to the properties of those fundamental particles. And this is something that is known under the word reductionism. It's a particular type of But of course, those properties is not the only thing that we talk about and it's not the only thing We also talk about human but somewhat more mundanely, we also talk about things of certain material, say, There's nothing in the Standard that tells you what's the color of a metal or something like this. Those are all what we They don't exist on this underlying fundamental but they're properties of that in principle, we could calculate. Sometimes we can actually really by way of sophisticated mathematics. In most cases, we cannot. There are certainly no particle physicists who can calculate what if you give them the properties of all the particles in your body. But in principle, you know, If you had a big enough computer, you would be able to calculate it. There's no observation that contradicts this So on some level you could say that, yeah, we are really just constituted of all those elementary particles and all that we can do comes about from the interaction of those particles. Even though that might be an entirely useless description of us, it's nevertheless correct. But I think that actually Or if on a different level, you could say we're by which I mean that is not the particles that we are made of. It's what those particles can do. And that's what's contained of how those particles are put together, that they make up a human body, someone who can walk and talk and think and write books or fly to the Where does this come from? Well, it comes from the way And when I say to some extent, we're actually less than those atoms, I mean that in principle, we could replace those maybe certain silicon structures, and we could put them in with the same possibilities of interaction as we have in the human body, and for all we currently know about the fundamental laws of nature, that artificially-composed human should be able to walk and talk exactly the same way as you can. I actually think that this because it means that in principle, it should be possible and actually not just but your entire body to a computer, because there's nothing All this information about the configuration well, you can formulate it in mathematics and put it onto a computer.

      " Are we close to solving a theory of everything? - A theory of everything in is the theory that combines all the fundamental forces of nature. We currently know four of those forces. That's the electromagnetic force, which pretty much everyone has heard of. Then there's the strong The strong nuclear force holds together the particles that make up atomic nuclei, and the weak nuclear force is Those are all quantum theories. This is the fourth force, and And this is kind of the problem. It's kind of the weird outlier. And a theory of everything would combine all those four Starting in the 1970s and 1980s, a lot of physicists became very optimistic that we're pretty close to And string theory was one of the biggest candidates for this. And partly in response John Horgan in 1996 wrote his where he picks up several and tries to argue that actually we're And this possibility of there eventually that'll just explain it all and that's the end of the This story about there that will eventually just is one of the things that But he's also going on about there being no progress in biology and all this stuff about nothing is happening there, And I have to admit that it's You could have the perspective that there is a certain period where we make those big and it's just behind us. There was also some period where we mapped the surface It's not going to happen that we'll discover another continent. And it's a good question to ask, like is the same the case with science? Have we just discovered all the big things that there are to discover? And Horgan is not saying or we'll stop doing research, but he's saying that there'll We'll just add some bits and pieces to the stuff that we already have. And as someone who has worked I have to totally disagree on being close to a theory of everything. And I guess this also with a lot of my colleagues I think we're nowhere And one of the reasons is that we still don't have that would combine the Standard And yes, string theory But it's fallen out of favor. It's not even clear that it it was meant to solve in the first place. And pretty much the about other approaches to quantum gravity. So this thing is still unsolved. And I also, in contrast to a that even if we solve this riddle, it'll not be the end of the story. It'll just bring up new things. It'll open new questions. But maybe even more importantly, we have a much bigger problem which is the measurement Personally, I think that's the big crack in the foundations of physics. We don't really understand It's created some in how we analyze experiments. Physicists are just confused that we have to do this Exactly what is a measurement? Who or what does a measurement? What does it take to do a measurement? We don't know. The theory And I think that an answer is needed. John Horgan recently became and actually looked at he pretty much came to which is that quantum mechanics can't possibly be the last word. There's got to be The way that I think about it is really from a You need to find some kind of crack to which you can apply your tools to pare it open and let the light in. And indeed, when we find this answer, it'll lead to a lot of progress. And it's not just progress in It's also progress by Because if you look at all that we use today, they're all All this stuff about semiconductors and gaps in electron bands and so on, it's all quantum mechanics. So if we manage to improve this by eventually understanding how I think this will also help us to improve our technological gadgets and it'll have a huge So I don't think we're anywhere (light-hearted music) - \n",

So sooner or later, they'll something that they can't explain, and then they will call for the theorists to please explain this. And this is when a lot of progress is going to happen very suddenly.
