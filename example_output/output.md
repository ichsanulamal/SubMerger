## 2. What is IT

Welcome to course one, Technical Support Fundamentals. My name is Kevin Limehouse and I work as a support specialist for platforms building DoubleClick at Google. Looking back, I can trace from my passion for IT began, to an actual moment when I was eight years old. My parents were about to throw away our old busted computer, but I managed to convince my mom to let me keep it. I remember the moment when I slowly started disassembling it, kept digging deeper and deeper unscrewing every little piece I can get my hands on and I was hooked. By the time I was 12 or 13 years old, I became the de facto IT support for my entire family and that's no small feat considering, I have 11 aunts and uncles and over 35 cousins. My parents both grew up in very small rural towns in South Carolina. Growing up in the Jim Crow south through the mid 1950s and 1960s, they were taught at an early age that one of the better methods to get ahead was through education. This lesson was instilled in me and my sister and I ended up going to university to study computer science. I graduate at school right at the end of the 2007, 2009 recession, but thankfully I secured a job at Google in IT support, where I work with users, solving their issues and supporting the IT inventory. And now I've been working in IT for seven years and my current role as a support specialist, I provide technical and billing support to the Google sales teams which involves everything from troubleshooting to creating forms or editing automation scripts. Now you know a little bit about me. Let's start from the beginning. What is information technology? Information technology has completely transformed your life in ways that you may not even realize. Thanks to IT, we can communicate massive amounts of information to people and organizations across the world, in the blink of an eye. Computers power everything from calculators, to medical equipment, to complex satellite systems and the trading desk of Wall Street. They are powerful and invaluable tools to help people get their work done and enable us to connect with one another. So what exactly is information technology? IT is essentially the use of digital technology, like computers and the internet, to store and process data into useful information. The IT industry refers to the entire scope of all the jobs and resources that are related to computing technologies within society, and there are a lot of different types of jobs in this field, from network engineers who ensure computers can communicate with each other, to hardware technicians who replace and repair components, to desktop support personnel who make sure that end users can use their software properly. But IT isn't just about building computers and using the Internet, it's really about the people. That's the heart and soul of IT support work. What good is technology or information if people can't use technology or make sense of the information? IT helps people solve meaningful problems by using technology, which is why you'll see its influences in education, medicine, journalism, construction, transportation, entertainment, or really any industry on the planet. IT is about changing the world through the ways we collaborate, share and create together. IT has become such a vital tool in modern society that people and organizations who don't have access to IT are at a disadvantage. IT skills are becoming necessary for day to day living, like finding a job, getting an education and looking up your health information. Maybe you're from a community where there wasn't any internet, or you couldn't afford a superfast computer and had to use one at your school or library instead. There are many social and economic reasons why some people have digital literacy skills and other people do not. There's growing skills gap is known as the digital divide. People without digital literacy skills are falling behind. But people like you are the real solution to bridging that digital divide. Overcoming the digital divide, not only involves confronting and understanding the combination of socio economic factors that shape our experience, but also helping others confront and understand those experiences. By getting into IT, you'll help serve those in your communities or organizations and maybe even inspire a new generation of IT pioneers. When I think about solving the digital divide, I can't help but think of all the opportunities and breakthroughs that folks from diverse backgrounds and perspectives in the industry can bring. By bringing more people of color, more women, more ethnically diverse people into the IT fields, we're bound to see unique new ideas and products that we haven't even begun to imagine that benefits everybody.

## 3. What does an IT Support Specialist do

So what's the day-to-day work of someone in IT support like? Well, it varies a ton, based on whether you're doing in personal or remote, support and at a small business or a large enterprise company. And there's really no such thing as day-to-day work, since the puzzles and challenges are always new and interesting. But in general, an IT support specialist makes sure that an organization's technological equipment is running smoothly. This includes managing, installing, maintaining, troubleshooting and configuring office and computing equipment. This program is designed to prepare you for an entry level role in IT help desk support. You'll learn how to setup a user's desktop or workstation, how to install the computer applications that people use the most. You'll learn how to fix a problem or troubleshoot when something goes wrong and how to put practices in place to prevent similar problems from happening again. Not only will you learn the technical aspects of troubleshooting a problem, you'll also learn how to communicate with users in order to best assist them. We'll also show you how to set up a network from scratch to connect to the Internet. Teach you a thing or two about automation and scripting and teach you about how to implement security to make sure your systems are safe from hackers and other risk. For me, my favorite part of IT support is the problem solving aspect. I love to exercise my creativity to spin up a solution to a user's issue. Being an IT journalist also gave me the flexibility to learn and practice so many different skills and eventually determined where I want to focus my career. Plus, when things go wrong or you fail at something in IT, you can take the feedback from those mistakes and be better equipped to tackle them the next time around. Using failure as a feedback, is an important skill both in IT and in life. For me, that's why I was so attracted to the IT field. I love the process of problem solving and constantly stretching myself to learn and grow. There's also never been more opportunity to get into the IT industry than now. Not only is the field of IT incredibly diverse, but job prospects are also booming. It's projected that IT jobs in the US alone will grow 12% in the next decade. That's higher than the average for all other occupations. So what does this all mean? There are thousands of companies around the world searching for IT professionals like you. So the main gist is that IT is totally awesome and full of opportunity, and we're so excited that you're here. So let's dive right in.

## 4. Course Introduction

On July 20th, 1969, one of the most phenomenal events made his way into the history books. When the Apollo 11 completed its historic mission to the moon. Although the most brilliant minds helped to make sure that the Eagle had landed, computers also played a significant role. The guidance system that navigated the spacecraft was one of the earliest forms of modern computing. That same computer, the one that helped America's lunar dreams become a reality, took up the space of an entire room and had one-10,000th the computing power of the thing that almost everyone of you carry in your pockets today, a smartphone. Computer hardware and software have had such a dramatic evolution that what was once only used to power rockets, now shapes the entire way our world functions. Think about your day, did you grab a snack? Turn on your TV? Take a driving in your car? Computers were along for the ride literally, computers are everywhere. So, here's the rundown. By the end of this course, you'll understand how computers work and get a grasp of the building blocks of IT. We're going to cover the basics of how computer hardware performs calculations, and we're going to actually build a computer from the ground up. We'll look at how operating systems control and interact with hardware, we'll take a look at the Internet and get a better understanding of how computers talk to each other. We'll also spend time learning about how applications and programs tie all of this together, and let humans interact with these systems. Finally, we'll cover important lessons on problem-solving with computers, and cover the communication skills that are so critical when interacting with others in IT. Whether you're looking for a job in the IT industry or you just want to learn higher laptop connects to the Internet, understanding how computers work at every level can help you in your day-to-day life and in the workplace. But first, let's take a step way back, back to where all begin, even before the Apollo 11 mission touchdown so you can understand how and why we use computers today.

## 1. From Abacus to Analytical Engine

When you hear the word computer, maybe you think of something like a beefy gaming desktop with flashing lights, or maybe you think of a slim and sleek laptop. These fancy devices aren't what people had in mind when computers were first created. To put it simply, a computer is a device that stores and processes data by performing calculations. Before we had actual computer devices, the term computer was used to refer to someone who actually did the calculation. You're probably thinking that's crazy talk. A computer lets me check social media, browse the Internet, design graphics, how can it possibly just perform calculations? Well, friends, in this course, we'll be learning how computer calculations are baked into applications, social media, games et cetera, all the things that you use every day. But to kick things off, we'll learn about the journey computers took from the earliest known forms of computing into the devices that you know and love today. In the world of technology, and if I'm getting really philosophical, in life, it is important to know where we've been in order to understand where we are and where we are going. Historical context can help you understand why things work the way they do today. Have you ever wondered why the alphabet isn't laid out in order on your keyboard? The keyboard layout that most of the world uses today is the qwerty layout, distinguished by the Q, W, E, R, T, and Y keys in the top row of the keyboard. The most common letters that you type aren't found on the home row, where your fingers hit the most. But why? There are many stories that claim to answer this question. Some say it was developed a slow down typist so they wouldn't jam old mechanical typewriters. Others claim it was meant to resolve problem for telegraph operators. One thing is for sure, the keyboard layout that millions of people use today isn't the most effective one. Different keyboard layouts have even been created to try and make typing more efficient. Now that we're starting to live in a mobile-centric world with our smartphones, the landscape for keyboards may change completely. My typing fingers are crossed. In the technology industry, having a little context can go a long way to making sense of the concepts you'll encounter. By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to identify some of the most major advances in the early history of computers. Do you know what an abacus is? It looks like a wooden toy that a child would play with, but it's actually one of the earliest known computers. It was invented in 500 BC to count large numbers. While we have calculators like the old reliable TI-89s or the ones in our computers, abacuses actually are still used today. Over the centuries, humans built more advanced counting tools but they still required a human to manually perform the calculations. The first major step forward was the invention of the mechanical calculator in the 17th by Blaise Pascal. This device used a series of gears and levers to perform calculations for the user automatically. While it was limited to addition, subtraction, multiplication and division for pretty small numbers, it paved the way for more complex machines. The fundamental operations of the mechanical calculator were later applied to the textile industry. Before we had streamlined manufacturing, looms were used to weave yarn into fabric. If you wanted to design patterns on your fabric, that took an incredible amount of manual work. In the 1800s, a man by the name of Joseph Jacquard invented a programmable loom. These looms took a sequence of cards with holes in them. When the loom encountered a hole, it would hook the thread underneath it. If it didn't encounter a hole, the hook wouldn't thread anything. Eventually this spun up a design pattern on the fabric. These cards were known as punch cards. And while Mr. Jacquard reinvented the textile industry, he probably didn't realize that his invention would shaped the world of computing and the world itself today. Pretty epic Mr. Jacquard, pretty epic. Let's fast forward a few decades and meet a man by the name of Charles Babbage. Babbage was a gifted engineer who developed a series of machines that are now known as the greatest breakthrough on our way to the modern computer. He built what was called a difference engine. It was a very sophisticated version of some of the mechanical calculators we were just talking about. It could perform fairly complicated mathematical operations but not much else. Babbage's follow up to the difference engine was a machine he called the Analytical Engine. He was inspired by Jacquard's use of punch cards to automatically perform calculations instead of manually entering them by hand. Babbage used punch cards in his Analytical engine to allow people to predefine a series of calculations they wanted to perform. As impressive as this achievement was, the Analytical engine was still just a very advanced mechanical calculator. It took the powerful insights of a mathematician named Ada Lovelace to realize the true potential of the analytical engine. She was the first person to recognize that the machine could be used for more than pure calculations. She developed the first algorithm for the engine. It was the very first example of computer programming. An algorithm is just a series of steps that solves specific problems. Because of Lovelace's discovery that algorithms could be programmed into the Analytical engine, it became the very first general purpose computing machine in history, and a great example that women have had some of the most valuable minds in technology since the 1800s. We've covered a lot of ground already, learning about how primitive counting devices like the abacus evolved into huge complex devices like the Analytical engine, proof that there was life before social media. In the next video, we'll learn about how these mechanical machines made the leap into modern computing.

## 2. The Path to Modern Computers

Welcome back. In this video, we'll be learning how huge devices like the Analytical Engine grew, I mean, shrunk into the computing devices that we use today. The development of computing has been steadily growing since the invention of the Analytical Engine but didn't make a huge leap forward until World War II. Back then, research into computing was super expensive, electronic components were large and you needed lots of them to compute anything of value. This also meant that computers took up a ton of space and many efforts were underfunded and unable to make headway. When the war broke out, governments started pouring money and resources into computing research. They wanted to help develop technologies that would give them advantages over other countries, lots of efforts were spun up and advancements were made in fields like cryptography. Cryptography is the art of writing and solving codes. During the war, computers were used to process secret messages from enemies faster than a human could ever hope to do. Today, the role cryptography plays in secure communication is a critical part of computer security which we'll learn more about in a later course. For now, let's look at how computers started to make dramatic impact on society. First up is Alan Turing, an English mathematician and now famous computer scientist. He helped develop the top-secret Enigma machine which helped Allied Forces decode access messages during World War II. The Enigma machine is just one of the examples of how governments started to recognize the potential of computation. After the war, companies like IBM, Hewlett-Packard, and others were advancing their technologies into the academic, business, and government realms. Lots of technological advancements and computing were made in the 20th century thanks to direct interest from governments, scientists, and companies left over from World War II. These organizations invented new methods to store data in computers which fueled the growth of computational power. Consider this, until the 1950s punch cards were a popular way to store data. Operators would have decks of ordered punch cards that were used for data processing. If they dropped the deck by accident and the cards got out of order, it was almost impossible to get them sorted again. There were obviously some limitations to punch cards, but thanks to new technological innovations like magnetic tape and its counterparts, people began to store more data on more reliable media. A magnetic tape worked by magnetizing data onto a tape. Back in the 1970s and 80s, people used to listen to music on vinyl records or cassette tapes. These relics are examples of how magnetic tapes can store information and run that information from a machine. This left stacks and stacks of punch cards to collect dust while their new magnetic tape counterparts began to revolutionize the industry. I wasn't joking when I said early computers took up a lot of space. They had huge machines to read data and racks of vacuum tubes that help move that data. Vacuum tubes control the electricity voltages and all sorts of electronic equipment like televisions and radios, but these specific vacuum tubes were bulky and broke all the time. Imagine what the work of an I.T. support specialist was like in those early days of computing. The job description might have included crawling around inside huge machines filled with dust and creepy crawly things, or replacing vacuum tubes and swapping out those punch cards. In those days, doing some debugging might have taken on a more literal meaning. Renowned computer scientist Admiral Grace Hopper had a favorite story involving some engineers working on the Harvard Mark II computer. They were trying to figure out the source of the problems in a relay. After doing some investigating, they discovered the source of their trouble was a moth, a literal bug in the computer. The ENIAC was one of the earliest forms of general purpose computers. It was a wall-to-wall convolution of massive electronic components and wires. It had 17,000 vacuum tubes and took up about 1,800 square feet of floor space. Imagine if you had to work with that scale of equipment today. I wouldn't want to share an office with 1,800 square feet of machinery. Eventually, the industry started using transistors to control electricity voltages. This is now a fundamental component of all electronic devices. Transistors perform almost the same functions as vacuum tubes but they are more compact and more efficient. You can easily have billions of transistors in a small computer chip today. Throughout the decades, more and more advancements were made. The very first compiler was invented by Admiral Grace Hopper. Compilers made it possible to translate human language via a programming language into machine code. In case you didn't totally catch that, we'll talk more about compilers later in this course. The big takeaway is that this advancement was a huge milestone in computing that led to where we are today. Now, learning programming languages is accessible for almost anyone anywhere. We no longer have to learn how to write machine code in ones and zeros. You get to see these languages in action in future lessons where you'll write some code yourself. Side note, if the thought of that scares you, don't worry, we'll help you every step of the way. But for now, let's get back to the evolution of computers. Eventually, the industry gave way to the first hard disk drives and microprocessors. Then, programming language started becoming the predominant way for engineers to develop computer software. Computers were getting smaller and smaller, thanks to advancements in electronic components. Instead of filling up entire rooms like ENIAC, they were getting small enough to fit on tabletops. The Xerox Alto was the first computer that resembled the computers we're familiar with now. It was also the first computer to implement a graphical user interface that used icons, a mouse, and a window. Some of you may remember that the sheer size and cost of historical computers made it almost impossible for an average family to own one. Instead, they were usually found in military and university research facilities. When companies like Xerox started building machines at a relatively affordable price and at a smaller form factor, the consumer age of computing began. Then in the 1970s, a young engineer named Steve Wozniak invented the Apple I, a single-board computer MIT for hobbyists. With his friend Steve Jobs, they created a company called Apple Computer. Their follow up to the Apple I, the Apple II, was ready for the average consumer to use. The Apple II was a phenomenal success, selling for nearly two decades and giving a new generation of people access to personal computers. For the first time, computers became affordable for the middle class and helped bring computing technology into both the home and office. In the 1980s, IBM introduced its personal computer. It was released with a primitive version of an operating system called MS DOS or Microsoft Disk Operating System. Side note, modern operating systems don't just have text anymore, they have beautiful icons, words, and images like what we see on our smartphones. It's incredible how far we've come from the first operating system to the operating systems we use today. Back to IBM's PC, it was widely adopted and made more accessible to consumers, thanks to a partnership with Microsoft. Microsoft, founded by Bill Gates, eventually created Microsoft Windows. For decades it was the preferred operating system in the workplace and dominated the computing industry because it could be run on any compatible hardware. With more computers in the workplace, the dependence on I.T. rose and so did the demand for skilled workers who could support that technology. Not only were personal computers entering the household for the first time, but a new type of computing was emerging: video games. During the 1970s and 80s, coin-operated entertainment machine called arcades became more and more popular. A company called Atari developed one of the first coin-operated arcade games in 1972 called Pong. Pong was such a sensation that people were standing in lines at bars and rec centers for hours at a time to play. Entertainment computers like Pong launch the video game era. Eventually, Atari went on to launch the video computer system which help bring personal video consoles into the home. Video games have contributed to the evolution of computers in a very real way, tell that to the next person who dismisses them as a toy. Video game show people that computers didn't always have to be all work and no play, they were a great source of entertainment too. This was an important milestone for the computing industry, since at that time, computers were primarily used in the workplace or at research institutions. With huge players in the market like Apple Macintosh and Microsoft Windows taking over the operating systems space, a programmer by the name of Richard Stallman started developing a free Unix-like operating system. Unix was an operating system developed by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie, but it wasn't cheap and wasn't available to everyone. Stallman created an OS that he called GNU. It was meant to be free to use with similar functionality to Unix. Unlike Windows or Macintosh, GNU wasn't owned by a single company, its code was open source which meant that anyone could modify and share it. GNU didn't evolve into a full operating system, but it set a foundation for the formation of one of the largest open source operating system, Linux, which was created by Linus Torvalds. We'll get into the technical details of Linux later in this course, but just know that it's a major player in today's operating systems. As an I.T. support specialist, it is very likely that you'll work with an open source software. You might already be using one like the internet browser Mozilla Firefox. By the early 90s, computers started getting even smaller, then a real game changer made its way into the scene: PDAs or personal digital assistants, which allows computing to go mobile. These mobile devices included portable media players, word processors, email clients, Internet browsers, and more all in one handy handheld device. In the late 1990s, Nokia introduced a PDA with mobile phone functionality. This ignited an industry of pocketable computers or as we know them today, smartphones. In mere decades, we went from having computers that weigh tons and took up entire rooms to having powerful computers that fit in our pockets. It's almost unbelievable, and it's just the beginning. If you're stepping into the I.T. industry, it's essential that you understand how to support the growing need of this ever-changing technology. Computer support 50 years ago consisted of changing vacuum tubes and stacking punch cards, things that no longer exist in today's I.T. world. While computers evolve in both complexity and prevalence, so did knowledge required to support and maintain them. In 10 years, I.T. support could require working through virtual reality lenses, you never know. Who knows what the future holds? But right now, it is an exciting time to be at the forefront of this industry. Now that we've run down where computers came from and how they've evolved over the decades, let's get a better grasp on how computers actually work.

## 1. Computer Language

Remember when I said that a computer is a device that stores and processes data by performing calculations? Whether you're creating an artificial intelligence that can beat humans at chess or something more simple, like running a video game, the more computing power you have access to, the more you can accomplish. By the end of this lesson, you'll understand what a computer calculates, and how. Let's look at this simple math problem. 0 +1 equals what? It only takes a moment to come up with the answer 1, but imagine that you needed to do 100 calculations that were this simple. You could do it, and if you were careful, you might not make any mistakes. Well, what if you needed to do 1,000 of these calculations? How about 1 million? How about 1 billion? This is exactly what a computer does. A computer simply compares 1s and 0s, but millions or billions of times per second. Wowza! The communication that a computer uses is referred to as binary system, also known as base-2 numeral system. This means that it only talks in 1s and 0s. You may be thinking, okay, my computer only talks in 1s and 0s. How do I communicate with it? Think of it like this. We use the letters of the alphabet to form words and we give those words meaning. We use them to create sentences, paragraphs, and whole stories. The same thing applies to binary, except instead of A, B, C, and so on, we only have 0 and 1 to create words that we give meaning to. In computing terms, we group binary into 8 numbers, or bits. Technically, a bit is a binary digit. Historically, we used 8 bits because in the early days of computing, hardware utilized the base-2 numeral system to move bits around. 2 to the 8th numbers offered us a large enough range of values to do the computing we needed. Back then, any number of bits was used, but eventually the grouping of 8 bits became the industry standard that we use today. You should know that a group of 8 bits is referred to as a byte. So a byte of zeroes and ones could look like 10011011. Each byte can store one character, and we can have 256 possible values, thanks to the base-2 system, 2 to the 8th. In computer talk, this byte could mean something like the letter C. And this is how computer language was born. Let's make a quick table to translate something a computer might see into something we'd be able to recognize. What does the following translate to? Did you get hello? Pretty cool, right? By using binary, we can have unlimited communication with our computer. Everything you see on your computer right now, whether it's a video, an image, text or anything else, is nothing more than a 1 or a 0. It is important you understand how binary works. It is the basis for everything else we'll do in this course, so make sure you understand the concept before moving on.

## 2. Character Encoding

Remember from the earlier video that a byte can store only zeros and ones. That means we can have 256 possible values. By the end of this video, you'll learn how we can represent the words, numbers, emojis and more we see on our screens, from only these 256 possible values. It's all thanks to character encoding. Character encoding is used to assign our binary values to characters so that we as humans can read them. We definitely wouldn't want to see all the text in our emails and Web pages rendered in complex sequences of zeros and ones. This is where character encodings come in handy. You can think of character encoding as a dictionary. It's a way for your computers to look up which human characters should be represented by a given binary value. The oldest character encoding standard used this ASCII. It represents the English alphabet, digits, and punctuation marks. The first character in ASCII to binary table, a lowercase a, maps to 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 in binary. This is done for all the characters you can find in the English alphabet as well as numbers and some special symbols. The great thing with ASCII was that we only needed to use 127 values out of our possible 256. It lasted for a very long time, but eventually it wasn't enough. Other character encoding standards recreated to represent different languages, different amounts of characters and more. Eventually they would require more than 256 values we were allowed to have. Then came UTF 8. The most prevalent encoding standard used today. Along with having the same ASCII table, it also lets us use a variable number of bytes. What do I mean by that? Think of any emoji. It's not possible to make emojis with a single byte, so as we can only store one character in a byte, instead UTF 8 allows us to store a character in more than one byte, which means endless emoji fun. UTF 8 is built off the Unicode Standard. We won't go into much of detail, but the Unicode Standard helps us represent character encoding in a consistent manner. Now that we've been able to represent letters, numbers, punctuation marks and even emojis, how do we represent color? Well, there are all kinds of color models. For now, let's stick to a basic one that's used in a lot of computers. RGB or red, green, and blue model. Just like the actual colors, if you mix a combination of any of these, you'll be able to get the full range of colors. In computerland, we use 3 characters for the RGB model. Each character represents a shade of the color and that then changes the color of the pixel you see on your screen. With just eight combinations of zeros and ones, were able to represent everything that you see on your computer, from a simple letter a, to the very video that you're watching right now on the Coursera website. Very cool. In the next video, we'll discuss how we actually generate the zeros and ones.

## 3. Binary

You might be wondering how our computers get these ones and zeros. It's a great question. Imagine we have a light bulb and a switch that turns the state of the light on or off. If we turn the light on, we can denote that state is one. If the light bulb is off, we can represent the state is zero. Now imagine eight light bulbs and switches, that represents eight bits with a state of zero or one. Let's backtrack to the punched cards that were used in Jacquard's loom. Remember that the loom used cards with holes in them. When the loom would reach a hole it would hooked to thread underneath, meaning that the loom was on. If there wasn't a hole, it would not hook the thread, so it was off. This is a foundational binary concept. By utilizing the two states of on or off, Jacquard was able to weave intricate patterns of the fabric with his looms. Then the industry started refining the punch cards a little more. If there was a hole, the computer would read one. If there wasn't a hole, it would read zero. Then, by just translating the combination of zeros and ones, our computer could calculate any possible amount of numbers. Binary in today's computer isn't done by reading holes. It uses electricity via transistors allowing electrical signals to pass through. There's an electric voltage, we would denote it as one. If there isn't, we would denote it by zero. For just having transistors isn't enough for our computer to be able to do complex tasks. Imagine if you had two light switches on opposite ends of a room, each controlling a light in the room. What if when you went to turn on the light with one switch, the other switch wouldn't turn off? That would be a very poorly designed loom. Both switches should either turn the light on or off depending on the state of the light. Fortunately, we have something known as logic gates. Logic gates allow our transistors to do more complex tasks, like decide where to send electrical signals depending on logical conditions. There are lots of different types of logic gates, but we won't discuss them in detail here. If you're curious about the role that transistors and logic gates play in modern circuitry, you can read more about it in the supplementary reading. Now we know how our computer gets its ones and zeros to calculate into meaningful instructions. Later in this course, we'll be able to talk about how we're able to turn human-readable instructions into zeros and ones that are computer understands through a compilers. That's one of the very basic building blocks of programming that's led to the creation of our favorite social media sites, video games, and just about everything else. And I'm super excited to teach you how to count in binary, that's up next.

## 4. How to count in Binary

Binary is the fundamental communication block of computers, but it's used to represent more than just text and images. It's used in many aspects of computing like computer networking, which you'll learn about in a later course. It's important that you understand how computers count in binary. We've shown you simple lookup tables that you can use like the ASCII to binary table, but as an IT support specialist, whether you're working on networking or security, you'll need to know how binary works. So let's get started. You'll probably need a trusty pen and paper, a calculator, and some good old-fashioned brain power to help you in this video. The binary system is how our computers count using ones and zeros, but humans don't count like that. When you were a child, you may have counted using ten fingers on your hand. That innate counting system is called the decimal form or base-10 system. In the decimal system, there are 10 possible numbers you can use ranging from zero to nine. When we count binary, which only uses zero and one, we convert it to a system that we can understand, decimal. 330, 250, 2, 40, 4 million, they're all decimal numbers. We use the decimal system to help us figure out what bits our computer can use. We can represent any number in existence just by using bits. That's right. And we can represent this number just using ones and zeros. So how does that work? Let's consider these numbers: 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, and 1. What patterns do you see? Hopefully, you'll see that each number is a double of the previous number going right to left. What happens if you add them all up? You get 255. That's kind of weird. I thought we could have 256 values for a byte. Well, we do. The zero is counted as a value, so the maximum decimal number you can have is 255. What do you think the number is represented here? See where the ones and the zeros are represented. Remember, if our computer sees a one, then the value was on. If it sees a zero, then the value is off. If you add these numbers up, you'll get a decimal value. If you guessed 10, then you're right. Good job. If you didn't get it, that's okay too. Take another look. The 2 and 8 are on, and if we add them up, we get 10. Let's look at our ASCII to binary table again. The letter h in binary is 01101000. Now, let's look at an ASCII to decimal table. The letter h in decimal is 104. Now, let's try our conversion chart again. 64 plus 32 plus 8 equals 104. Look at that. The math checks out. Now, we're cooking. Wow! We've gone over all the essentials of the basic building blocks of computing and machine language. Next, you're going to learn how we build on top of this layer of computing to perform the task you'll do day to day.

## 1. Video Abstraction

When we interact with our computers we use our mouse, keyboard or even a touch screen. We don't tell it the actual zeros and ones it needs to understand something. But wait, we actually do. We just don't ever have to worry about it. We use the concept of abstraction to take a relatively complex system and simplify it for our use. You use abstraction every day in the real world, and you may not even know it. If you've ever driven a car, you don't need to know how to operate the transmission or the engine directly. There's a steering wheel, some pedals, maybe a gear stick. If you buy a car from a different manufacturer, you operate it in pretty much the same way even though the stuff under the hood might be completely different. This is the essence of abstraction. Abstraction hides complexity by providing a common interface, the steering wheel, pedals, gear stick, and gauges in our car example. The same thing happens in our computer. We don't need to know how works underneath the hood. We have a mouse and a keyboard we can use to interact with it. Thanks to abstractions, the average computer user doesn't have to worry about the technical details. We'll use this under the hood e metaphor throughout the program to describe the area that contains the underlying implementation of the technology. In computing, we use abstraction to make a very complex problem, like how to make computers work, easier to think about. We do that by breaking it apart into simpler ideas that describe single concepts or individual jobs that need to be done, and then stack them in layers. This concept of abstraction will be used throughout this entire course. It's a fundamental concept in the computing world. One other simple example of abstraction in an IT role that you might see a lot is an error message. We don't have to dig through someone else's code and find a bug. This has been abstracted out for us already in the form of an error message. A simple error message like file not found actually tells us a lot of information and saves us time to figure out a solution. Can you imagine if instead of abstracting an error message our computer did nothing and we had no clue where to start looking for answers? Abstraction helps us in many ways that we don't even realize.

## 2. Computer Architecture Overview

In the last video I mentioned that people don't need to understand how a computer works for them to use it, because abstraction makes things simpler for us. That's technically true, but since you're stepping into the world of IT, you do need to understand all the layers of a computer and how they work. It's essential that you understand how the different pieces interact so you can resolve any issue that may arise. For the rest of this course we'll deep dive into the layers of computer architecture, and learn all the parts that make up a computer. A computer can be cut into four main layers, hardware, operating system, software, and users. The hardware layer is made up of the physical components of a computer. These are objects you can physically hold in your hand. Laptops, phones, monitors, keyboards, you get the idea. In the next lesson you'll learn all of the components of the computer and how they work. You'll even be able to build your own computer by the end of this module. The operating system allows hardware to communicate with the system. Hardware is created by many different manufacturers. The operating system allows them to be used with our system, regardless of where it came from. In the next few lessons, you'll learn about the major operating systems that we use today, and you'll be able to understand all of the underlying components that make up an operating system. By the end of these lessons, you'll have a strong grasp on the major components of any operating system, like Android or Windows, and use that knowledge to navigate any operating system. The software layer is how we as humans interact with our computers. When you use a computer, you're given a vast amount of software that you interact with, whether it's a mobile app, a web browser, a word processor, or the operating system itself. Later in this course, we'll learn how software is installed on our systems, and how we interact with different types of software. The last layer may not seem like it's part of the system, but it's an essential layer of the computer architecture, the user. The user interacts with the computer and she can do more than that. She can operate, maintain, and even program the computer. The user layer is one of the most important layers we'll learn about. When you step into the field of IT, you may have your hands full with the technical aspects, but the most important part of IT is the human element. While we work with computers every day, it is the user interaction that makes up most of our job, from responding to user emails to fixing their computers. By the end of the course, you'll also learn how to apply your knowledge of how a computer works to fix real world issues that can sometimes seem random and obscure. We'll do this by learning how to utilize problem solving tactics to identify issues and solutions. There's a lot ahead. The next instructor you're going to meet is a friend of mine, Devon. And I know there's no better person to teach you about hardware. He'll even show you how to build a computer from its component parts, pretty cool. But before you get to building that computer, we've got a quiz coming up for you on binary counting.

# Week 2

## 1. Module Introduction

Isn't the history of computers super interesting? I love going back in time and seeing how we got to this exciting point in computing. You've already taken the first few steps to building your foundational knowledge of IT, and before we dive deeper, I'd like to take a moment to introduce myself. My name is Devan Sri-Tharan, I've been working in IT for ten years. I'm a Corporate Operations Engineer at Google where I get to tackle challenging and complex IT issues. Thinking back, my first experience with tech began when I was about nine years old, when my dad brought home the family's first computer. I remember my dad holding a floppy disk and telling me that there was a game on it. To my dad's amazement I somehow managed to copy the game from disk onto the computer's hard drive. While it might seem like a trivial task now, this devise was just so new to us back then. Sure, I loved the different games I could play, but what I really loved was tinkering with the machine, trying to get it to do what I want it to do. While that floppy disk computer might have ignited my passion for technology, it was actually my first few job experiences that really started to shape my IT career. One was in retail, [LAUGH] selling baby furniture and the other was at a postal store, where I helped customers ship their packages, and became the one person IT crew. It might sound odd that working in retail inspired my career, but I've realized I really enjoy communicating with customers, trying to understand their needs and offering a solution. My first experience working directly in IT was in college as an IT support specialist intern. From there, I worked as an IT consultant to decommission an entire IT environment. This was my first experience working directly with large IT infrastructure, and pushing myself outside my comfort level as a college student. I bring up these few jobs for a reason. These experiences helped shape my career in IT. I knew at that time that I wanted to go into tech, but I struggled where I wanted to focus my career. Starting at Google as an IT generalist allowed me to experience many different areas of technology. It allowed me to figure out the jobs I didn't want to do, before I was able to identify exactly what I did want to do. Really passionate about IT infrastructure, but you can't understand infrastructure until you understand hardware. So let's dig in. In IT, hardware is an essential topic to understand. You might find yourself replacing faulty components or even upgrading an entire fleet of machines one day. By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to describe all the physical parts of a computer and how they work together. You'll even be able to build your own computer. Once you figure out how one computer works, you'll be able to understand how any type of computer works. Excited? I am, let's get started.

## 2. Introduction to Computer Hardware

Let's face it, computers are everywhere. You come into contact with them at home, work, the airport, the grocery store, you're using some type of computer to take this course. You know what? There's probably one in your pocket right now. While computers are complex and can seem daunting to learn, they ultimately just calculate, process, and store data. In this lesson, we're going to take a peek at what's inside of the computer. We'll spend the next few lessons explaining how each of these components work. But for now, let's check out a typical desktop setup. Desktops are just computers that can fit on or under our desks. So here we have a monitor, a keyboard, a mouse, and a desktop. Sometimes you might even add a webcam, speakers, or a printer set up. We'll call these physical components, hardware. Let's take a look at the back of the computer. You can see common connectors here, the power outlet here, and the common ports here. Ports are connection points that we can connect devices to that extend the functionality of our computer. We're going to detail about the ports you see here in a later lesson. But here's a quick rundown. We have a port here to connect to a monitor, and a few ports here to plug your keyboard and mouse. There's another important one here for our network connection. With just these ports, we're able to have the basic functionality to browse the web and much more. Things look pretty similar in a laptop. Here are some of the same ports. A built-in monitor, And a keyboard. There are also physical components inside the laptop case that are hidden for portability. Once you figure out how one computer works, you can figure out how any other computer works. Okay, this is my favorite part. Let's open up this desktop and take a deeper look. Let me first clean up my desk. Get ready for it. Whoa, it looks pretty complicated, but that's okay. We'll take you through it. Let's start with a quick tour. Then we'll dive deeper into each of these parts in the next lesson. Right here, this component, it's a CPU or central processing unit, which is covered by this heat sink. You could think of the CPU as the brain of our computer. The CPU does all the calculations and data processing. It communicates pretty heavily with this component right here, RAM or Random Access Memory. RAM is our computer's short-term memory. We use this component when we want to store data temporarily. Like let's say, you're typing something into a chat or a piece of text in a word processor. This information is stored in the RAM. Don't worry, we'll cram in more details on RAM in the later lesson. When we want to store anything in long-term memory, we use this component here, the hard drive. The hard drive holds all of our data, which can include music, pictures, applications. Let me show you something else interesting. Have you noticed this large slab here? This is our motherboard. It holds everything in place and lets our components communicate with each other. It's the foundation of our computer. You can think of the motherboard as the body or circulatory system of the computer that connects all the pieces together. The last component we'll talk about is our power supply, which converts electricity from our wall outlet onto a format that our computer can use. You know what's interesting? All these components make up most computers, even a mobile phone. While it might look very different from your laptop, a mobile phone just uses a smaller version of the hardware that we saw in the desktop and laptop today. So now that we've covered the basic anatomy of the computer, we'll go over each of these components in depths in the next few lessons. Understanding how computer hardware works is a really helpful skill set in IT support, since an IT department maintains the hardware that a company uses. A solid understanding of these computer internals will come in handy when troubleshooting hardware related problems, and taking things apart to see how they work is just super fine.

## 3. Programs and Hardware

Before we get our hands dirty with learning how to build a computer, let's talk theory first. In an earlier lesson, we talked about binary, and how computers perform calculations. Remember that our computer can only communicate in binary, using ones and zeroes. Our computers speak in machine language, but we of course speak in human languages, like English, Spanish, Mandarin, Hindi. You get the idea. If we want to communicate with our machines, we have to have some translation dictionary. Just if I wanted to say something in Spanish, I'd look it up in an English-Spanish dictionary. Well our computers have a built-in translation book. In this lesson, we'll dive deeper into how our computer translates the information we give it into instructions that it understands. Right now, you're probably using a web browser, music player, text setter or something else in your computer. We interact with these applications on a daily basis. They are referred to as Programs. Programs are basic instructions that tell the computer what to do. We technically store programs on durable media like hard drives. You can think of programs like cooking recipes. We get these recipes all stored together in a cook book just like apps stored in a hard drive. Now we want to make a ton of food. So we hire a chef to follow our recipes and whip up something good. The faster our chef works, the more food she'll prepare. The chef is our CPU, she processes the recipes we send her and makes the food. Our chef works super fast, so fast that she can cook faster than she can read. So, we take copy of the recipes and put them into RAM. Remember that RAM is our computer's short-term memory. It stores information in a location our CPU can access faster than it could with our hard drive. Now we can give our chef one or two recipes at a time, instead of reciting the entire cookbook to her. Okay, now let's say I want to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. I see a pretty good recipe, and send it to our chef to make. Remember that our chef needs these instructions quickly, so I don't send her the entire recipe, I send her one line at a time. 1, Get two slices of bread. 2, Put peanut butter on one slide. 3, Put jelly on another slice. 4, Combine the two slices of bread. Now, let me throw one more thing at you. Our chef can only communicate with us in ones and zeroes. So instead of sending something readable, like the recipe for a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, we have to send her something like this. In reality, this process is a little more complicated. Our CPU is constantly taking instructions and executing them. These instructions are written in binary but how do they travel around the computer? In our computer, we have something called the External Data Bus or EDB. It's nothing like a bus at all. It's a row of wires that interconnect the parts of our computer, kind of the veins in our body. When you send a voltage to one of the wires, we say the state of the wire is on, or represented by a 1. If there's no voltage, then we say that the state is off, represented by a 0. This is how we send around our ones and zeroes. Sound familiar? The last lesson we talked about how transistors help us to send voltages. Now we know how our bits physically travel around computer. The EDB comes in different sizes, 8 bit, 16 bit, 32, even 64. Can you imagine if you had 64 wires going? You can move around a lot more data. Right now, were just going to stick with using an EDB with 8 bits in our examples. Sending 1 byte at a time. Okay so now, our CPU is receiving a byte and it needs to get to work. Inside the CPU there are components known as Registers. They let us store the data that our CPU works with. If for example, our CPU wanted to add two numbers, one number would be stored in a register a. Another number would be stored in register b. The result of those two numbers would be stored in register c. Imagine the register is one of our chef's work tables. Since she has a place to work, she can start to cook. To do so she uses a translation book to translate her binary into tasks that she can perform. Let's jump back for a second. Remember that our programs are copied into RAM for the CPU to read. RAM is memory that is randomly accessed, allowing our CPU to read from any part of RAM as quickly as any other part. We don't actually send data from RAM over the EDB. There would be way to much stuff. RAM can hold millions, even billions, of rows of data. Despite our sandwich example, most of our recipes aren't simple at all. There can be thousands of lines long. We want to process them and we don't actually go in any particular order. Since we can only send one line of data through the EDB at the time, we need the help of another component, the Memory Controller Chip or MCC. The MCC is a bridge between the CPU and the RAM. You can think of it, a nerve in your brain connecting to your memories. The CP talks to the MCC, and says, hey, I need the instructions for step number three of this recipe. The MCC finds the instructions for step number three in RAM, grabs the data, and sends it through the EDB. There's another bus. There's nothing like a bus involved in the process called the Address bus. It connects the CPU to the MCC, and sends over the location of the data, but not the data itself. Then the MCC takes the address and looks for the data. And then data is then sent over the EDB. Believe it or not, RAM isn't the fastest way we can get more data to our CPU for processing. The CPU also uses something known as Cache. Cache is smaller than RAM, but it let's us store data that we use often, and let's us quickly reference it. Think of RAM like a refrigerator full of food. It's easy to get into, but it takes time to get something out. On the flip side of that, Cache is like the stuff we have in our pockets. It's used to store recently or frequently accessed data. There are three different cache levels in a CPU, L1, L2, and L3. L1 is the smallest and fastest cache. If you're interested in learning more about this, you can check out the supplemental reading I've included right after this video. So now we understand how our RAM interacts with our CPU. But how does our CPU know when the set of instruction ends, and a new one begins. Our CPU has an internal clock that keeps its operational in sync. It connects to a special wire called Clock wire. When you send or receive data, it sends a voltage to that clock wire to let the CPU know it can start doing calculations. Think of our clock wires as the ticking of a clock. For every tick, the CPU does one cycle of operations. When you send a voltage to the clock wire, it's referred to as a clock cycle. If you have lots of data you need to process in a command. You need to run lots of clock cycles. Have you ever seen a CPU in the store and has something labeled 3.4ghz, this number refers to the Clock speed of the CPU. Which is a maximum number of clock cycles that it can handle in a set in a certain time period. 3.40 gigahertz is 3.4 billion cycles per second. That's super fast. But just because it can run at this speed, doesn't mean it does. It just means that it can't exceed this number. Still, that number doesn't stop some people from trying. There's a way you can exceed the number of clock cycles on your CPU on almost any device. It's referred to as Overclocking and it increases the rate of your CPU clock cycles in order to perform more tasks. This is commonly used to increase the performance in low-end CPUs. Let's say you're a gamer and you want to have better graphics and less lag while playing. You might want to overclock your CPU when you play the game, but there are cons to doing this, like potentially overheating your CPU. You can read more about overclocking in the next supplementary reading.

## 1. CPU

If someone asked you, calculate the square root of 5,439,493, would you do the math by hand? Unless you really love tedious Math problems, you'd probably use a calculator. What about binary? Well, you probably wouldn't calculate binary by hand either. There's actually a very powerful calculator right inside of your computer that processes binary for us. We've already discussed this calculator in detail. Do you know what it is? It's our CPU, the brain of our computer. In this video, we'll cover the more practical aspects of the CPU. Remember that transition book that I talked about in an earlier lesson? The CPU uses this to translate and perform functions on our data. This transition book is called an instruction set, which is literally just a list of instructions that our CPU is able to run. Functions like adding, subtracting, copying data are all instructions that our CPU can carry out. Every single program on your computer, while extremely complex, is broken down into very small and simple instructions found in our instruction set. Instruction sets are hard-coded into our CPU. So different CPU manufacturers may use different instructions sets. But they generally perform the same functions. It's like how car manufacturers build their engines differently but they all get the same job done. You probably work with computer hardware as an I.T. support specialist, replacing failed hard disks, upgrading RAM modules, and installing video cards. So you need to be aware of what's out there. You've probably heard of a few popular CPU manufacturers or chipsets like Intel, AMD and Qualcomm. These CPU manufacturers use different part names to differentiate their processors. Like Intel Core i7, AMD Athlon, Snapdragon 810, Apple A8, and more. Now, when you hear these terms, you'll know what they mean. Each of these CPU manufacturers have their strengths and weaknesses. If you're interested in learning more about why some CPUs are more popular than others, you can check out the next supplemental reading. When you select your CPU, you need to make sure it's compatible with your motherboard. The circuit board that connects all your components together. Heads up. You can't just buy a bunch of parts and expect them to work together. There are different ways CPUs fit on motherboards using different sockets. Your CPU might have lots of tiny pins that either stick out or have contact points that look like dots. Depending on your motherboard, you need to make sure these CPUs fit correctly in the socket. There are currently two major types of CPU sockets, Land Grid Array also known as LGA, and Pin Grid Array, also known as PGA. In an LGA socket, like this one, there are pins that stick out of the motherboard. The socket size may vary. So always make sure you CPU and socket are compatible before hand. When you purchase the CPU or motherboard, they will tell you right on the box what type of socket it has. Make sure your CPU and motherboard socket also both match. If it's not listed on the box, you can go to the manufacturer's website where it usually list what types of CPUs are compatible with the motherboard. The other type of socket is the PGA socket, where the pins are located on the processor itself. When we install our CPU, we need to do a few things to it to keep it cool. Since it does a lot of work, it's prone to overheating. We have to make sure to include a heat sink, too, which takes the heat from our CPU and dissipates it through a fan or another medium. There's one last thing I want to call out about CPUs. If you purchase a CPU, you'll see that it has either a 32 bit or 64 bit architecture. What does that mean? Well, we know we can't process 8 bits in binary. Now, imagine how we can process with 32 or even 64 bits. CPUs that have 32 bit or 64 bit architecture are just specifying how much data it can efficiently handle. You can read more about the differences between 32 bit and 64 bit architecture in the next reading. For now, the main takeaway is that the CPU is one of the most important parts of a computer. So we have to make sure it's compatible with all other components and can perform well for our computing needs.

## 2. RAM

Let's talk about RAM, our computers' short term memory. We use RAM to store data that we want to access quickly. This data changes all the time so it isn't permanent. Almost all RAM is volatile, which means that once we power off our machines, the data stored in RAM is cleared. Remember that our computer is comprised of programs. To run a program, we need to make a copy of it in RAM so our CPU can process it. When you see a new phone or laptop that's says it has 16 gigs of RAM, that means it can run up to 16 gigs of programs, meaning you can run lots of programs at the same time. When you type in a document, you're using RAM. If you've ever had the misfortune of working on an important presentation of paper and losing power, you know the feeling you get when all of the work you've done is lost. It's a total bummer. This happens to anything with RAM, even video games. Have you ever gone on a long campaign without saving, then right as you get to a safe point, the power goes off on the console and all the progress you've made is lost forever? It's not fun at all. You spend the next hour or so deciding whether or not just to rage quit the game completely and start all over from scratch. Not that this happened to me or anything, that was just a friend. Anyway, all of this happens because RAM clears it's data. There are lots of types of RAM. And the one is commonly found in computers, is DRAM or dynamic random access memory. Where a one or zero is sent to DRAM, it source each bit in a microscopic capacitor. This is either the charge or discharge represented by one or zero. These semiconductors are put into chips that are on the RAM and store our data. There are also different types of memory states that DRAM chips can be put on. The more modern DIMM sticks, which usually stands for Dual Inline Memory Module, have different sizes of pins on them. I should call out, we don't really buy RAM based on the number of DRAM chips they have. They are labeled by the capacity of RAM on a stake, like an 8 gig stick of RAM. After DRAM was created, RAM manufacturers build something called SDRAM which stands for Synchronous DRAM. This type of RAM is synchronized to our systems' clock speed allowing quicker processing of data. In today's system, we use another type of RAM, called double data rate SDRAM, or DDR SDRAM for short. Most people refer to this RAM as DDR, even shorter. There were lots of iterations of DDR, from DDR1, DDR2, DDR3 and now, DDR4. DDR is faster, takes up less power, and has a larger capacity than earlier SDRAM versions. The latest version, DDR4, is the fastest type of short term memory currently available for your computer. And faster RAM means that programs can be run faster and that more programs can run at the same time. Keep in mind that any RAM sticks you use need a compatible motherboard with a different number of pins aligned with the motherboard RAM slots. Just like with the CPU, make sure that your motherboard is compatible with any RAM sticks that you buy. Up next, we'll take a deep dive into motherboards.

## 3. Motherboards

The motherboard, the foundation that holds our computer together. It lets us expand our computer's functionality by adding expansion cards around its power from the power supply and it allows the different parts of the computer to communicate with each other. In short, it's a total boss. Every motherboard has a few key characteristics. First is the chipset, which decides how components talk to each other on our machine. The chipset on motherboards is made up of two chips. One is called the Northbridge that interconnects stuff like RAM and video cards. The other chip is the Southbridge which maintains our IO or input/output controllers, like hard drives and USB devices that input and output data. In some modern CPUs, the Northbridge has been directly integrated into the CPU so there isn't a separate Northbridge chipset. A chipset is a key component of our motherboard that allows us to manage data between our CPU, RAM, and peripherals. Peripherals are the external devices we connect to our computer like: a mouse, keyboard, and a monitor. You'll learn more about peripherals in an upcoming lesson. In addition to the chipsets, motherboards have another key characteristic which allows the use of expansion slots. Expansion slots also give us the ability to increase the functionality of our computer. If you want to upgrade your graphics card, you could purchase one and just install it on your motherboard through the expansion slot. The standard for an expansion slot today is the PCI Express or Peripheral Component Interconnect Express. A PCIe bus looks like a slot on the motherboard and a PCIe base expansion card looks like a smaller circuit board. The last component of motherboards that we'll discuss is form factor. There are different size of motherboards that are available today. These sizes of form factors determine the amount of stuff we can put in it and the amount of space we'll have. The most common form factor for motherboards is ATX which stands for Advanced Technology eXtended. ATX actually comes in different sizes too. In desktops, you'll commonly see full sized ATX's. If you don't want to use an ATX form factor, you could use an ITX or Information Technology eXtended form factor. These are much smaller than ATX boards. For example, the Intel NUC uses a variation of the ITX board which comes in three board sizes; mini-ITX, nano-ITX, and pico-ITX. When building your computer, you will need to keep in mind what type of form factor you want. Do you want to build something small that can't handle as much workload? Or, do you want a powerhouse workstation that you can add lots of functionality to? The form factor will also play a role into what expansion slots you might want to use. Understanding motherboards and their characteristics can be a big plus when fixing hardware issues, since things like the type of RAM module or processor socket are dependent on the kind of motherboard they need to fit into. Let's say you're responding to a ticket for a user who is having video problems, you don't want to make it all the way to their desk only to realize the graphics card due board as a replacement doesn't fit the motherboard their computer uses. You'll learn more about customer service and troubleshooting tactics later on in this course. But for now, make sure that your motherboard can fit any replacement or upgrade that you want to implement.

## 4. Storage

So, before we get into computer storage, we need to fill in some gaps. I'm referring to things like gigabytes, bits, etc. But we actually haven't talked at all about what those metrics mean. Sorry, I kind of get a bit ahead of myself. As you might have guessed, these terms refer to data sizes. The smallest unit of a data storage is a bit. A bit can store one binary digit, so it can store a one or zero. The next largest unit of storage is called a byte, which is comprised of 8 bits. A single byte can hold a letter, number or symbol. The next largest unit is refer to as kibibyte, but we typically use the term kilobyte. A kilobyte is made up of 1,024 bytes. If you're curious why 1 kilobyte refers to as 1,024 bytes and not 1,000 bytes, you can read more about that in the next supplemental reading. For now, here's a quick data conversion chart. How much does 500 gigabytes even mean? Let's take a look at the size of an average music file, which is about three megabytes. On a 500 gigabyte machine, that's approximately 165,000 music files. That's a lot of music. We store all of our computer's data on our hard drive, which allows us to store our programs, music, pictures, etc. Have you ever had an issue with your computer and lost all the data that was on your hard drive? Yeah, me too, it was the worst. This actually happens a lot and you'll probably encounter it as an IT support specialist. Make sure you backup your data to be safe. This means you should copy or save your data somewhere else, just in case something goes wrong and your hard drive crashes. That way, you won't lose all your data. There are two basic hard drive types used today. Hard disk drives, or HDDs, use a spinning platter and a mechanical arm to read and write information. The speed that the platter rotate allows you to read and write data faster. This is commonly referred to as RPM, or revolution per minute. A hard drive with a higher RPM is faster, so if you go out and buy a hard drive today, you might see something like a 500 gigabyte with 5400 RPM. HDDs are prone to a lot more damage because there are a lot of moving parts. This susceptibility to damage went away with a new type of storage called solid state drive, or SSD. SSDs have no moving parts. Are you familiar with a USB stick? SSDs are created in a similar way. The information is stored on microchips and data travels a lot faster than HDDs. The form factor for SSDs is also slimmer compared to their HDD cousins. Sounds great, doesn't it? So why doesn't everyone use SSDs? Well, both have their pros and cons. HDDs are more affordable, but they're more prone to damage. SSDs are less risky when it comes to losing data, but they're also more expensive. So you may not buy as much memory storage in SSDs than what you can get in HDDs. Believe it or not, there are even hybrid SSD and HDD drives out there. They offer SSD performance where you need it. For things like system performance, such as booting your computer, along with hard disk drives for less important stuff, like basic file storage. There are a few interfaces that hard drives use to connect to our system. ATA interfaces are the most common ones. The most popular ATA drive is a serial ATA, or SATA, which uses one cable for data transfers. SATA drives are hot swappable. Great term, don't you think? It means you don't have to turn off your machine to plug in a SATA drive. SATA drives move data faster and use a more efficient cable, like this one, than it's predecessors. SATA has been the de facto interface for HDDs today. But people quickly found that using a SATA cable wasn't good enough for some of the blazing fast SSDs that were coming on the market. The interface couldn't keep up with speed of the newest SSDs. So another interface standard was created called NVM Express, or NVMe. Instead of using a cable to connect your drive to your machine, the drive was added as an expansion slot, which allows for greater throughput of data and increased efficiency.

## 5. Power Supplies

In order to get our computer to work, let's give it some power. Computers have a power supply that converts electricity from your volt to something usable. There are two types of electricity, DC, or direct current, which flows in one direction and AC, or alternating current, which changes directions constantly. Our computers use DC voltage, so we have to have a way to convert the AC voltage from our power company to something we can use. That's what our power supply does. It converts the AC we get from the wall into low voltage DC power that we can use and transmit throughout our computer. So let's talk about power supplies. I actually have one right here. Let me show you how one looks like. Let me take it out right here. So most power supply units have a fan, which is right in here. They also has voltage information just normally listed underneath or on the side, and cables, like this one, to power your motherboard, and, A power cable. Have you ever plugged one of your devices into the wall outlet and fried your device? If you haven't, you're really lucky. After completing this lesson, hopefully you will know how to avoid that situation. To understand electricity, we must use the example of water pipes. Our sinks have a faucet that's connected to a pressurized water tank. When we turn on the faucet, water comes out. This is sort of like how electricity works. When we plug an appliance into a wall outlet and turn it on, a flow of electricity comes out. If we added more pressure to our water tank, would more water come out of it? The higher the pressure, the more water there will be. When it comes to electricity, we refer to the pressure as voltage. So when I was on vacation, to my surprise, when I plugged in that 120 volt appliance into a 220 volt outlet, the power came busting through and fried my charger. If it was the other way around, and a 220 volt appliance was plugged into a 120 volt outlet, I wouldn't have seen the same outcome. I'll still be able to get electricity, but slowly. This would be similar to if a water tank whose only half pressurized, it will drew water, but slowly. In some cases though, this can deteriorate the performance of the device and cause damage in the long term. As a general rule, be sure to use the proper voltage for your electronics. We refer to the amount of electricity coming out as current or amperage, and it's measured in amps. We can think of amps as pulling electricity, as opposed to voltage, which pushes electricity. Amps will pull as much electricity needed, but voltage will just give you everything. Look on the back of the one of your device charges, you might see something like 1 or 2.1a. Charging a device with 2.1 amps will actually charge a device faster because it's able to put current from a 2.1 amp than a 1 amp charger. Finally, the other important part of the electricity that you will need to know is the wattage. Wattage is the amount of volts and amps that a device needs. If your power supply has too low of a wattage, you won't be able to power your computer, so make sure you have enough. This doesn't mean that if you have a large power supply, you'll overpower your computer. Power supplies just give you the amount that your system needs. It's best to error on the side of large power supplies. You can power most basic desktops with a 500 watt power supply, but if you're doing something more demanding on your computer, like playing a high-resolution video game or doing a lot of video production and rendering, you'll likely need a bigger power supply for your computer. On the other hand, if all you're doing is just browsing the Web, the power supply that comes with your computer should be fine. All kinds of issues are caused by a bad power supply. Sometimes the computer doesn't even turn on at all. Since power supplies can fail for lots of reasons like burnouts, power surges, or even lightning strikes, knowing how to diagnose power issues and replace a failed power supply is a skill every IT support specialist should have in their toolbox.

## 6. Peripherals

So, let's take a look at the back of our computer again. Here, you'll see lots of connectors or ports. We can plug in different objects like a mouse, keyboard, and a monitor. These are known as peripherals. A peripheral is basically anything that you connect to your computer externally that adds functionality. You probably used USB devices before. USB, also known as Universal Serial Bus devices are the most popular connections for our gadgets. USB has gone through lots of changes since inception. You most commonly encounter USB 2.0, USB 3.0, and 3.1 in today's system. Here's a quick rundown of the different versions. USB 2.0 transfers speeds of 480 megabytes per second, USB 3.0 transfers speeds of five gigabytes per second, USB 3.1 transfers speeds of 10 gigabytes per second. In the chart, let's pay attention to the details. Using capital M lowercase b forward slash s instead of using capital M capital B to reference transfer speed. These are actually different units. MB is megabyte or unit of data storage, while capital M lower case b forward slash s is a megabit per second, which is a unit of data transfer rate. People often mistake speeds of 40 megabit per second to mean that you can transfer 40 megabytes of data per second. Remember, that one byte is 8 bits, so to transfer a one megabyte file in a second you need an 8 megabits per second connection speed. So, to transfer 40 megabytes of data in a second, you need a transfer speed of 240 megabits per second. You'll also need comparable USB ports to go with your devices. If you connect a USB 2.0 device into a USB 3.0 port, you won't get 3.0 transfer speeds. But you can still use the port since it's backward compatible, meaning older hardware work with newer hardware. The ports are easy to differentiate. Let me show you. In general, USB 2.0 are black and USB 3.0 are blue and 3.1 ports are teal. This may change depending on manufacturers. There are lots of types of USB connectors, and you can read about all of them in the supplemental reading right after this video. Check it out. Back to USB connectors. The most recent one is the type C connector which is meant to replace many peripheral connections. It's quickly becoming a universal standard for display and data transfer. In addition to USB peripherals, you should also be aware of display peripherals. There are some common inputs standards to know. Most computer monitors will have one or more of these connections, but you might encounter some older standards too. DVI. DVI cables generally just output video. If you need to hook up a monitor or projector for a slide presentation and you want audio too, you may be out of luck. Instead, you want to look at one of the following cables. HDMI. This has become a standard in lots of televisions and computers nowadays and outputs both video and audio. Another standard that's become popular among manufacturers is a displayPort which also outputs audio and video. In addition to audio and video, USB type C can also do data transfer and power. As an IT support specialist, you'll work with peripherals like USB devices and display devices a lot. Now, you'll be able to distinguish between the major types. In the next lesson, we're going to learn how our computer initializes all of the hardware we talked about.

## 1. BIOS

Okay, now we've seen all the key components to get our computer running. The last thing we'll go over is how our devices talk to each other. We know how programs execute from our hard drive to our CPU, but how do other things like a mouse click or a keyboard press get sent to our CPU for processing? These are fairly basic devices, they don't contain any instructions that our CPU knows how to read. If you just clicked on the key from your keyboard, you'd only be sending a byte to the CPU. The CPU doesn't know what this is, because it doesn't have instructions on how to deal with it. Turns out our devices also use programs to tell the CPU how to run them. These programs are called services or drivers. The drivers contain the instructions our CPU needs to understand external devices like keyboards, webcams, printers. Our CPU doesn't know that there is a device that it can talk to, so it has to connect to something called the BIOS, or basic input output services. The BIOS is software that helps initialize the hardware in our computer and gets our operating system up and running. Unlike the programs, you're probably used to running a web browser or operating system. The BIOS isn't stored on a hard drive. Our motherboard stores the BIOS in a special type of memory called, the read-only memory chip, or ROM chip. Unlike RAM, ROM is non-volatile, meaning it won't erase the data if the computer is turned off. Once the operating system loads, we're able to load drivers from non-essential devices, directly from the hard drive. In today's system, there is another player for BIOS called UEFI, which stands for Unified Extensible Firmware Interface. UEFI performs the same function of starting your computer as a traditional BIOS. But it's more modern and has better compatibility and support for newer hardware. Most hardware out there today comes with UEFI built in. Eventually, UEFI will become the predominant BIOS. When you turn on a computer, you might notice a beeping from time to time. How computers run a test to make sure all the hardware is working correctly. This is called a Power On Self Test or POST. And then BIOS runs it when you boot up your computer. The POST figures out what hardware is on the computer. So it happens before the BIOS initializes any hardware or loads up essential drivers. If there is an issue with anything at that point, there is no way to display it on the screen, since things like the video driver haven't been loaded. Instead, the computer can usually produce a series of beeps, almost like Morse code, which will help identify the problem. Different manufacturers have different beep codes. So, if your computer successfully boots up, you may hear a single beep. If you hear two beeps, it could mean a POST error. It's best to refer to your motherboard manual to find out what each code means. Also, you should know that not all machines have built-in speakers, so don't worry if your computer boots without a beep. If it does have a built-in speaker, being able to distinguish what the beep codes mean is an extremely helpful tool when troubleshooting boot issues. One last thing, we will discuss are BIOS settings. There is a special chip on our motherboard called the CMOS chip. It stores basic data about booting your computer like the date, time and how you wanted to start up. You can change these settings by booting into CMOS or BIOS setting menu. It varies in different computers, but usually when you boot the computer, there will be a quick screen that tells you what button to push to get into the settings. From there, you can change the basic BIOS settings of your machine. An an IT support role, you might interact with the BIOS more often than you think. BIOS settings control which devices to boot to and in an IT role, you might need to change the settings more often than not. A frequently performed IT task is the reimaging of a computer. The term refers to a disk image which is a copy of an operating system. So the process of reimaging involves wiping and reinstalling an operating system. This procedure is typically performed using a program that's stored on some external device like a USB memory stick, or a CD ROM, or even a server accessible through the network. To access these programs and perform the reimage, you'll need to use the BIOS to tell the computer to boot up from that external device.

## 2. Putting it all together

Now that we've learned what the computer components are and how they work we're going to assemble our very own computer, a full size desktop. Computers are incredibly fundamental to the work of an IT support specialist. There used in pretty much every aspect of the job. Aside from work, knowing how to build a computer might inspire you to try all kinds of cool stuff. You could custom build a gaming rig to play the most advanced game at the highest setting or like me make a home media server for all you photos and videos. Knowing how to build a computer is a skill that can be useful in lots of interesting ways. Before we get started, let's lay down some ground rules for this ground up build, sorry, I cannot help myself. We should think about electrostatic discharge and try to prevent unwanted static from harming our very expensive components. Have you ever rubbed yourself socks on a carpet and then accidentally zap someone? That's pretty harmless, but if you that to your new motherboard, you completely destroy it. So how do we prevent static discharge? We can go about this in two ways, we can touch in our two device that's plugged in but not powered on. FYI, you should do this every couple of minutes when assembling a new computer. Another option is to wear an anti-static wristband like the one I have here, let me get it. You connect the end of the clip to a non-painted metal surface like your computer. And then you separate on to your hands and wallah your done. While we are on the subject of anti-static safety, I want to call out that when you buy computer parts, they'll come in anti-static bags to prevent accidental static electricity. Be sure to keep them inside the bags until you need to install them on your computer. Now, let's get making this computer, we'll start by laying down the foundation of our computer, the motherboard. Remember, there are lots of different form factors for motherboards and you want to make sure the one you purchase fits your computer case. We purchased the full size desktop cased and have a full size ATX motherboard. On the motherboard there are a lot of screw holes which coincide with the holes in the desktop case too. You want to match up the holes on the motherboard to the holes on the desktop. Once you figure out which holes to use screw in standoffs. Standoffs are used to raise and attach your motherboard to the case. In this instance our case has built in standoffs. Let's start start adding on components. Let's start by adding our components in. We'll start with the CPU, so let's take that out of our anti-static bag. You want to be very careful with these because they're very expensive, and you don't want to drop them. Once we've taken out the bag, let's line up the CPU with the motherboard's socket. Something to note is this marker right here. This has to align with the CPU socket on the motherboard. Also don't forget to make sure you get compatible CPU that fit your motherboard. We have a LGA CPU and an LGA-compatible motherboard socket. So let's go ahead and align the correct orientation of the CPU and secure it in place like this. So like mentioned before, you want to make sure that the pointers on the CPU and the socket are aligned. The easy part is putting the CPU in. The fun part is securing this, just note that when you secure the CPU in the socket you do need to use a bit of force so it's tightly secured in. Perfect, so now the CPU is secured in the socket. Now that our CPU is in place we need to add our heat sink on top of it. The heat sink is used to dissipate heat from our CPU. I want to show you some cool things. This part right here, this is what our CPU relies on to stay cool. It takes the heat from there and then uses this fan to blow it out. Before we attach the heat sink, we need to apply an even amount of thermal paste. Let me get that, this is the thermal paste. Thermal paste is used to better connect our CPU and heat sink. So the heat transfers from to the other better. To get started, apply a dab of thermal paste and spread evenly with a flat object. Lets do that on our CPU right here. So first thing that you want to do is slowly apply a slight dab on the CPU like so. Then with the flat object, apply the thermal paste evenly throughout your CPU to go half way right here, half way right here, Half way right here, and then half way right here. Just make sure that it spread evenly throughout the CPU. You may have to do this multiple times to get this correct. Okay, so once you have that in place, you're going to tank your heat sink and then you're going to press it against the CPU. And something to note is that these screws right here, they align with the CPU socket. So that can guide you while you put the heat sink on. Great, once you have all four sockets aligned, go ahead and get your screw driver and then tighten down the sockets. So one thing to do, is to make sure that you screw the opposite sides first so you know that the heat sink is attached securely. So one thing I like to do again is just kind of go over my screws to make sure everything is tightened securely. Great, now that our screws are tightly on in our heat sink secured to the CPU You have to plug this Molex to the motherboard. This is important because this is what controls the fan speed via the motherboard. Perfect. So now, you've fully installed and connected your CPU to the motherboard. Next, let's install our RAM. Located DIMM slots on your motherboard. So, these are the DIMM slots like we discussed before. I have four slots available here and I have four RAM sticks. Let me pick those up. These are my RAM sticks, and of course, they're in my anti-static bag Let's take them out. So, as I mentioned before, this build, we're going to use DDR3 RAM. All right, one thing I like to do before I install my RAM is to make sure that I align these slots with my RAM slots so that way I'm not going to be forcing those in when it's time to install. So, if you see right here, your slots are right in the middle so something I do is before I put it in, just visually make sure that you got this right and then align the rest of your RAM sticks to the same position like this. You just want to go like this. Like this. And like this. That way, you're not going to be damaging your pins if you pick your RAM sticks up and accidentally force it in. So now we've got that, we're going to put this in this slot right here. Line up the pins correctly and push in the RAM until you hear it click. You'll know it's secure when both sides of the RAMs are locked in place. And there's something else you should know. Your slots right here, they are both black and white. We're going to stick to using the white slots. This too. And we're also going to put this one right here. There you go. You've securely fastened your RAM inside your motherboard. Next, we have our hard drive. In this example, we're using an SSD SATA hard drive instead of a HDD. We just need to use one SATA cable to connect it to our motherboard. So, first, I'm going to go ahead and slot this in this cage This is going to vary from case to case, but this one's going to be easy. All we have to, we just slide it in like so. And normally you will hear a click, [SOUND] Like that. Once that's in, we just need to use one SATA cable to connect our SSD to our motherboard. Let me go and get that. So here we go. Here's a SATA cable. So what I'm going to do, is I'm going to connect this end to our SSD. I'm going to connect this end to our motherboard. There we go, it's in. Remember, SATA cables can only go in one way. So now that we have our SSD installed, let's go ahead and install our case fan. And this is how this looks like. One thing to note is the small x. You're going to go ahead and find a label on your motherboard that says, rear fans. Not all motherboards have this, but in this example, we do have that, so just to note. We get those into the grooves, there you go. My fan's installed, and now I'm going to go ahead and attach this to the Molex. There we go, now my fan is attached to my motherboard. For best practice, you want to create a wind tunnel that takes in air, blows it over your components, and then pushes it all out back. Check out how our heat sink has a fan on it too. That's pretty normal, since our CPU generates a lot of heat, and we want to help cool it off as best as we can. We're almost done. Now, we're going to connect our power and test to see if everything's working. So let's grab our power supply. Here we are. First, let's secure our power supply to our case. Be careful not to damage the motherboard when you install it. What you're going to do is you're going to put this in slowly like that, And then just slide it in. There you go. One thing I like to do, is I'd like to put my cables all the way out to the side, so like I mentioned before, it's not going to go ahead and damage the motherboard. So now, I'm going to go ahead and start securing our power supply. Its always fun getting in. There we go So as you can see, I normally like to go and start with my fingers, so it's easier to get in. And once I put all my screws in, I'm going to go ahead and use my screw driver and fasten it, tighten that. There you go. So let's go ahead and tighten our screws right here. [INAUDIBLE] And four. Great. So now, we've secured our power supply to the case so it's not going to move anywhere. And just another note, you can also install the power supply before adding it to the motherboard, depending on how your case is laid out. Lets go back to our mess of connectors. There are a few things I would like to highlight. This big one right here, this is the one that powers our motherboard. Another one that we have, it's more of a legacy one is this four pin Molex. These connectors were used heavily before SATA came out. Now, we use these connectors to power majority of the SATA devices today. Most modern machines today will probably use SATA power connectors for your hard drives so that it may come with Molex to SATA adapters. Now, it's time for the fun part. First, let's go ahead and connect our power supply to our motherboard. So that's this big pin as we discussed earlier. It's going to go in right here. And plug that in like so. Next, we're going to go ahead and power the CPU, with this A pin Molex right here. It's [INAUDIBLE] pretty tight, but you should be able to get it in. There you go. So what we just did was we have the power supply that is powering the motherboard and the CPU. So now that we've hooked up the cable to our CPU and motherboard, the next thing that we need to hook up are these cables that are sitting in our case. This is going to vary from case to case, but let's go through it. Some of these cables are used for your case's buttons and lights. So for this one, I'm going to plug these in. Okay. Okay, so our case cables are now secured to our motherboard. One good idea is sometimes your motherboard will come with some guides. This will help you fasten your cables to your motherboard so it's clean and tight on your case. I'm just going to go ahead and do that right here. Now that we have our cables securely fastened to our case, let's don't forget one more thing, our graphics card. We'll need that so that we can upload video to our monitor. We're going to plug this graphics card into our PCI-Express slot on our motherboard. Just like the RAM, you are going to put a little bit of pressure when you insert this in. So don't feel bad by putting a little bit of pressure and you'll hear a click like this. Once you've done it, you can tightly secure it to your case. This is going to vary from case to case. And there you go, your graphics card has been installed. All right, I think that's it. Let's cover up our computer. First make sure you take your anti-static brace right away. Get our case. Put that in like so, and just plug, and that's it. There you go, we finally built our machine. Last but not least, let's connect our monitor, keyboard, and mouse to the desktop. So first, let's get our keyboard. What we're going to do is we're going to connect this USB to the USB port on our desktop. Then we'll going to get our mouse, do the same thing. Connect this to our USB port. And then finally we're going to go ahead and connect our monitor. For this monitor, we're going to go ahead and use a display port cable. I want to connect one end to our desktop, like so. Next, I want to plug this into my monitor. All right, this is the most interesting part. Let's see if all this works. So I'm going to power it on. I got a blue light, which is good. And of course it's going to vary from system to system. Let's see if something shows up on the monitor. So computer is booting up. Let's see, okay it looks like the monitor is receiving signal, which is good. There we have messages, success, there we go, it's working, perfect. If you're having issues with your computer not starting up, that's okay. Check that your power supply can supply the correct amount of wattage or make sure your connectors are in the right place. What's this? Non-system disk or disk error, replace and strike any key when ready. It looks like our disk doesn't have an operating system to boot into, no worries. That's what we'll be discussing in the next set of lessons. We'll learn what an operating system is and what the main operating systems are and how to install one. Well good job, you've got your computer up and running and the monitor is receiving signal, so that's it. Let's take a moment and think about what you just did, not only did you learn about each component of a computer, but you figured out how they work individually and then we built one together. It's quite an accomplishment. For your next assignment, we build a widget that will let you assemble a computer digitally, putting all the different parts together or if you have all the computer parts already, you can assemble one in real life and then write a short review process of how you did it. If you get stuck, don't worry, go back and review the different videos covering the various components. I know you can do it. I've had lots of fun teaching you all about hardware and don't worry, we'll meet again soon when you make it to the system administration IT infrastructure services course. Next up, my good friend, Cindy Quach, is going to introduce you to operating systems. Operating systems are absolutely essential in IT considering that without them none of this hardware we've discussed would be able to accomplish anything. Tell Cindy I said hi.

# Week 3

## 1. Module Introduction

Welcome back. You've learned about the basics of computing with binary and the hardware layer of the computer architecture. Now, it's time to move onto the next layer, the operating system. By the end of this lesson, you'll know what an operating system is and what makes up an operating system. You'll also get some hands-on experience with the three biggest operating systems used today. Before we get deeper into operating systems, I'd like to introduce myself to you. My name is Cindy Quach and I'm a site reliability engineer at Google. The team I work on is responsible for the management and support of Google's entire internal mobile fleet: Android OS, iOS, and Chrome OS. Before focusing on mobile, I was a systems administrator on the links team, and before that, I was an operations engineer. But like a lot of the Googlers you've met and will meet, I started my career as an I.T. support specialist. I've been working in I.T. for seven years now. The first time I can remember interacting with computers was in middle school, where my teacher brought them into our classroom so we could create fun video and multimedia projects. It was my brother who brought technology into our house. My parents were immigrants from Vietnam and we didn't have a lot of money growing up, so we had to be creative if we wanted to play with a computer at home. I can remember spending hours with my brother as he assembled a computer and I would just ask a million questions. Eventually, I wanted to try and build my own computer, so I gathered up some old parts and saved money to buy new components. I finally put all the parts together from what I remembered my brother doing but it just didn't work. It turns out that I used some incompatible parts. But through a lot of trial and error, troubleshooting, and long search sessions on the internet, I finally got it to work. The feeling I got when I heard my computer boot up for the first time was amazing, and before I knew it, I was hooked on computers. I really enjoyed the intense concentration and problem solving required in I.T. but I didn't think a career in tech was even possible back then. Once I got to college, I had to find a job to help pay for tuition and that job was an I.T. support specialist on campus. That's when I realized that tech is actually something I could pursue as a career. Operating systems are an essential part of I.T. support. Everyone uses a computer to accomplish something, whether that's browsing the web, writing a novel, making graphics, playing video games, et cetera. Whatever the case may be, they need to interact with their operating system to do. In I.T. support, it's essential to understand how operating systems work so you can help someone accomplish the task they set out to do, whether that's figuring out why an application won't start, why the graphics look funny on their video games, or anything else. Things can get really messy and challenging and that's part of the fun. So let's begin.

## 2. Components of an Operating System

We introduced the concept of an operating system in earlier lessons. But what is it exactly? A lot of us hear the term operating system and think of the interfaces of our desktops and phones like the menus, buttons, and backgrounds. Technically, these are part of the operating system, but it's a little more complex than that. An operating system is the whole package that manages our computers resources and lets us interact with it. There are two main parts to an operating system, the kernel and the user space. The kernel is the main core of an operating system. It talks directly to our hardware and manages our systems resources. As users, we don't interact with the kernel directly. Instead, we interact with the second part of an operating system the, user space. The user space is basically made up of everything outside the kernel. The users thinks that we interact with directly like system programs, user interfaces, etcetera. When we say operating system, we're talking about both the kernel and the user space. There are hundreds of operating systems out there, but we'll focus on the major ones used in IT; Windows, Mac, and Linux. The Windows OS is developed by Microsoft and used widely in the business and consumer space. Most PCs you buy come with windows as the default operating system. PC means personal computer, which technically means a computer that one person uses. But in today's world, PC is more commonly referred to as a Windows computer. So, we'll just refer to a PC as a Windows computer from here. The Mac OS by Apple, is mainly used in the consumer space. If you buy an Apple computer, it'll come with Mac OS preloaded. The last operating system we'll dive into is the Linux operating system. Linux is an open source operating system, which means its software is free to share, modify, and distribute. Linux is used heavily in business infrastructure and in the consumer space. Linux itself is actually a kernel developed by Linus Torvalds. Because of the way it evolved, we call the Linux kernel the Linux operating system. Today, Linux has become a huge community effort with developers all over the world contributing to its success. Because Linux is open source, lots of different organizations package their own version of it. Operating systems like Windows or Macintosh on the other hand, are solely developed by their respective companies. We call these different Linux OSes distributions. Some common Linux distributions are Ubuntu, Debian, and Red Hat. Another operating system that has started to gain popularity is Chrome OS, but we won't go into detail on that one. You can read more about it in the supplemental reading right after this video. We also won't go over any of the operating systems used in mobile devices like Android OS, iOS, and Windows 10 mobile. But you should be aware that mobile phone operating systems are quickly overtaking their desktop counterparts in terms of quantity. Mobile phone usage around the world is more prevalent than desktop computers. You can read more about this in a supplemental reading. But in this course, we're only going to focus on the Windows and Linux operating systems since you'll most likely work with them in IT support. One cool thing to call out is that Chrome OS and Android OS both run the Linux kernel underneath the hood. So, there's a chance you've already worked with Linux and don't even know it. There are lots of operating systems out there and they all share common characteristics. If you're able to understand the basic building blocks of one OS, you can apply that to any operating system and understand how it works. In IT support, it's super common to work with many different operating systems from desktop OSes to smartphone OSes and more. Throughout the rest of this module, we're going to learn what an operating system is. More specifically, we're going to learn about the two components that make up an operating system, the kernel space and the user space. Before we get there, let's do a rundown of the basics. The kernel does file storage in file management. You can compare it to a physical office file where we store data in paper form. A computer file is just data that we store and a file can be anything, a word document, a picture, a song, literally anything. A file system is how we manage these files just like in an office, we use a system to store our files. We don't just put all our files on one cabinet, that would be seriously messy. Instead, we organize those files in folders or directories to make them easier to find. There are lots of different types of file systems, which we'll cover more in depth in future videos. Another important function of the kernel is process management. We have many programs that we want to run on our system. To run them, we manage the order they run in, how many resources they take up, how long they run, etcetera. Our kernel helps us do this with its process management capabilities. For example, you've probably used your computer to do several tasks at once. Maybe you write in a text document while listening to music or playing a video. The process scheduler is part of the kernel that makes this multitasking possible. It switches the execution of each different process on the CPU faster than you can blink, and it gives you the illusion that things are happening simultaneously. Next up is memory management. Our kernel optimizes memory usage and make sure our applications have enough memory to run. We won't get into too much detail right now, so stay tuned for more on this in the next few videos. The last important function that a kernel performs is input/output or I/O management. This is how our kernel talks to external devices like disks, keyboards, networks, connections, audio devices, and more. I/O management is anything that can give us input or that we can use for output of data. If you've ever saved a file to disk, click the mouse button, or use a microphone when video chatting with a friend, you've got the kernel's ability to manage I/O to thank. And that's the basic rundown of the main functions of the kernel; file management, process management, memory management, and I/O management. Finally, we'll talk about the other component of an operating system, the user space. The user space is everything outside the kernel. These are the things that we interact with directly like programs, such as text editors, music players, system settings, user interfaces, etcetera. By the end of this module, you'll hopefully have a solid understanding of all of these functions of an operating system. Let's start by taking a deeper dive into the kernel's file management.

## 4. Process Management

One of the most important tasks that our kernel performs is Process Management. A process is a program that's executing, like our internet browser or text editor. A program is an application that we can run, like Chrome. Take note of the difference. We can have many processes of the same program running at the same time. Think of how many Chrome windows you can open. These are all different processes for the same program. When we want to run our programs, we have to dedicate computer resources to them, like RAM and CPU. We only have a finite amount of resources and we want to be able to run multiple programs. A kernel has to manage our resources efficiently, so that all the programs we want to use can be run. Our kernel doesn't just dedicate all of our computers' resources to one process. Our system is actually constantly running multiple processes that are necessary for it to function, so our kernel has to worry about all of these processes at once. What a program wants to run, a process needs to be created for it. This process needs to have harder resources like RAM and CPU. The kernel has to schedule time for the CPU to execute the instructions in the process. But there's only one CPU and many processes. How does the CPU able to execute multiple processes at once? It actually does it, it executes processes one by one through something known as a time slice. A time slice is a very short interval of time that gets allocated to a process for CPU execution. It's so short that you don't even notice it. I mean, it's super short. The CPU execute one process in milliseconds then executes another process then another. To the human eye everything looks like it runs simultaneously, that's how fast the CPU works. If your computer is running slowly and your CPU resources are being maxed out, there could be many factors at play. It's possible that one process is taking up more time slices than it should. This means that the next process can't be executed. Another possibility is that there are too many processes that want CPU time and the CPU can't keep up with them. Whatever the case may be, even though the kernel does its best to manage processes for us, we might need to step in manually from time to time. We'll talk about how to manage processes in a later course. The kernel creates processes, efficiently schedules them, and manages how processes are terminated. This is important since we need a way to collect all the previously used resources that active processes were taking up and reallocate them to another process.

## 5. Memory Management

Remember that when a process runs, it needs CPU time, but it also needs memory. When processes are run, they have to take up space in memory, so that the computer can read and load them quickly. However, compared to our hard disk drives, memory comes in smaller quantities. So to give us more memory than we physically have, we use something called virtual memory. Virtual memory is a combination of hard drive space and RAM that acts like memory that our processes can use. When we execute a process, we take the data of the program in chunks we call pages. We store these pages in virtual memory. If we want to read and execute these pages, they have to be sent to physical memory or RAM. Why don't we just store the entire program in RAM so we can execute it quickly? Well, you could if it was small enough, but for large applications, it would be wasteful. Have you ever worked in a word processor, and then gone to a menu you don't normally use, and notice the application slow down a little? It's because your computer had to load the page for that menu from virtual memory into RAM. We don't use all the features of our application at once. So why load it up at once? It's similar to cooking a recipe from a cookbook. You don't need to read the whole book just to make one recipe. You only need to read the pages of the recipe you're currently using. When we store our virtual memory on our hard drive, we call the allocated space, swap space. When we get into practical applications of disk partitioning, we'll allocate space for swap. The kernel takes care of all of this for us, of course. It handles the process of taking pages of data and swapping them between RAM and virtual memory. But, the kernel isn't the only hard worker around. You've done great getting through the lessons so far. Nice work. Up next, we'll tackle I/O management. See you there.

## 6. I

So far, we've learned how hard our kernel works by handling files, managing files storage, juggling all the different processes running on our computer, and allocating memory. Another important task that our kernel handles, is managing input and output. We refer to devices that perform input and output, as I/O devices. These include our monitors, keyboards, mice, hard disk drives, speakers, bluetooth headsets, webcams, and network adapters. These I/O devices are all managed by our kernel, the kernel needs to be able to load up drivers that are used, so that we can recognize and speak to these different types of hardware. When the kernel is able to start the drivers to communicate with hardware, it also manages the transfer of data in, and out of the devices. I/O doesn't just mean the transfer of data between us and our devices, the devices also need to be able to talk to each other. Our kernel handles all the intercommunication between devices. It also figures out what the most efficient method of transfer is, and it tries its best to make sure our data doesn't have errors during process. When you're troubleshooting or solving a problem with a slow machine, it's usually some sort of hardware resource deficiency. If you don't have enough RAM, you can't load up as many processes. If you don't have enough CPU, you can't execute programs fast enough. If you have too much input coming into the device or too much output going somewhere, you'll also block other data from being sent or received. It's slow! is one of the most common problems you'll solve in an I.T. support role. Knowing the potential sources of that slowness is a big help when you're trying to narrow down the cause of the latency. Troubleshooting is such an important part of any IT support role. That's why, we'll share some troubleshooting best practices in detail, in upcoming lessons of this course. Beyond desktop support, identifying the source of a resource bottleneck in a server or large I.T. system like a web application, can unlock performance gains and new heights of responsiveness for your users.

## 7. Interacting with the OS

Okay, we've covered the kernel's major responsibilities. Now, let's discuss the final major aspect of an operating system, how humans interact with it. This is what we call, the userspace. When we interact with an operating system, we want to do certain functions like create files and folders, open applications, delete items, you get the idea. There are two ways that we can interact with our OS, with a shell or a graphical user interface. There are also some shells that use graphical user interfaces, but we'll work with the command line interface or CLIA shell for the most part. This just means that we'll use text commands. A graphical user interface or GUI, is a visual way to interact with a computer. We use our mouse to click and drag, to open folders etc. We can see everything we do with it. You probably use a GUI every day without realizing you're using one. To watch this video, you probably used a GUI. Clicking icons and navigating menus to open your web browser and navigate to the Coursera website. People usually recognize a device or product based on its GUI. You might be able to spot the difference between a computer running Microsoft Windows or Mac OS based on the design of the windows, menus and icons. You've probably seen GUIs in other places too, like mobile phones and tablets, ATM machines and airport kiosks. A shell is basically a program that interprets text commands and sends them to the OS to execute. Before we had fancy visual interfaces, commands like create a file had to be typed out. While we have GUIs today, the shell is still commonly used to run commands, especially by power users. Power users are above average computer users. In Linux especially, it's essential that you actually know commands, not just a GUI. This is because most of the Linux machines you interact with in IT support, will be accessed remotely. Most of the time, you won't be given a GUI. There are lots of different types of shells. Some have different features, some handle performance differently, it's the same concept behind different operating systems. For our purposes, we'll just be using the most common shell, Bash or Bourne Again Shell in Linux. There's also a shelf for Windows called Powershell, but we won't be covering it here. You'll learn more about Windows power shell and the third course of this program. Operating systems and you becoming a power user. Throughout this program, we'll learn how to use the Windows GUI and Windows shell, Powershell. You might be thinking, but it's easier for me to navigate a GUI,than it is to use commands to do the same thing. So why would I want to learn both? I can't stress this enough, it's vital for you to know how to use a shell in an IT support role. Some tasks can only be completed through commands. In more advanced IT roles, you might have to manage thousands of machines. You don't want to have to click a button or drag a window on every machine when you can just run a command once. You're actually going to learn how to automate this in a later course. Using a GUI and shell isn't all you'll be doing, we'll also interact with our operating system through applications. There are system applications and libraries that we use on a day-to-day basis, like the log in application, system settings and more. Throughout this course, you learn more about how to use system applications. And we'll even get hands-on with the applications used in your operating system.

## 8. Logs

Imagine this scenario: you're playing your favorite video game and you finally get to the big boss. You spent countless hours finding this boss neglecting all other responsibilities like your job, school, even hygiene. That's pretty gross but I get it. So, you're right about to kill the big boss when suddenly, your game console shuts off completely. You'll probably freak out for a second but then you remember, it's okay, you saved the game before the boss came along. So now, you can turn it back on and you'll be at the same spot but then your console shuts off again. This happens over and over. You like most people are devastated. You find to a fit of rage but then just before you toss your console out, you make one last ditch effort and yell, "Tell me, what's wrong with you?" Suddenly, you hear a faint voice telling you what you want to hear. Wouldn't that be amazing? Sure, that scenario was a bit exaggerated but my point is that our computers actually can talk to us and tell us what's wrong. Maybe they won't whisper answers to us, but they speak to us in the form of logs. Logs or files that record system events on our computer. Just like a systems diary our computer will record events like when it was turned on, when a driver was loaded and even when something isn't working in the form of error messages. In all operating systems, logs are kept so we can refer back to them when we need to find out something that happened. But logs can be hard to navigate because our computer will essentially record everything. Here's what a log looks like. As you can see, it can be tough to make your way through a log but with a little bit of elbow grease we can figure out what happened on our computer and piece together a solution. We'll see an example of how a log is useful in figuring out an issue in a later lesson. We'll dive into the technical details of logs in a later course. For now, just be aware that we can investigate details about our computer that aren't obvious to us. Unfortunately, our computers, cars, and machines don't have a little voice that tells us what's wrong when there's a problem. But by the end of this program, you'll be able to navigate and read logs, so you won't even need it.

## 9. the Boot Process

In this lesson, we're going to learn how our operating system starts up. As an IT support specialist, you'll probably work on lots of computers that won't start. It's important to know the steps an operating system takes so you can help diagnose the sort of issue. Booting a computer or starting a computer comes from the phrase to pull oneself up by one's bootstraps. Basically, it means to start from nothing and follow a series of steps to arrive at a fully operational system. When we start up a computer, we use the term boot. For most operating systems, the boot process follows a general pattern. Much like how we have different cars start up in the same way. Put in the key, turn on the ignition, et cetera. Here's a rundown of the boot process. First, the computer is powered on. Remember what we learned about the BIOS/UEFI in earlier videos? The BIOS/UEFI is a low-level software that initializes our computer's hardware to make sure everything is good to go. So next, the BIOS/UEFI runs a process called the Power On Self Test or POST. The POST performs a series of diagnostic tests to make sure that the computer is in proper working order. Next, depending on the BIOS/UEFI configuration, a boot device will be selected. Devices that are attached to our system, like hard drives, USB drives, CD drives, et cetera are configured in a certain boot order. The devices will be checked in this order and the computer will search for what's known as a bootloader. The bootloader is a small program that loads the operating system. Once our computer finds a bootloader on a device in the listed order, it will start to execute this program. This will then start to load a larger and more complex program and eventually loads our operating system. Once the bootloader loads up our operating system, our kernel gets loaded. The kernel controls access to our computers resources. It also loads up drivers and more, so that our hardware can talk to our software. Next, essential system processes and user space items are launched. These include processes like user log in, spinning up a desktop environment, and more which basically allows us to interact with our system. And that's it. After these simple steps, you'll be able to get to work.

## 1. Choosing an Operating System

In the last lesson you learned how an operating system boots up. It's an important concept to understand since you'll be faced with troubleshooting boot up issues in IT support. Now we're going to walk through the steps to select and install an operating system. We're going to focus on operating systems in the IT space. First, we'll talk about deciding which operating system to install in a business setting. Second, we'll dive into the overall process of installing an operating system. So how do you decide which operating system to install? Well, you need to ask yourself a couple of questions. Has the decision already been made? The operating systems in use by an organization have a lot to do with the applications and systems that they need to run. Are you working with an organization or service that requires the use of a specific operating system? If so, you're done that's easy. If the decision hasn't been made on what OS to use, or if you're looking for an operating system for personal use, then you need to ask yourself, what software will need to be run on this device. In lots of cases, the software will be designed to run on a specific operating system. It's also possible that the software is cross platform, meaning it can run on more than one operating system. Another question to ask is, what hardware will be used? Modern operating systems do a pretty good job of supporting common hardware. You should keep in mind that some manufacturers allow their opperating system to be only installed on their hardware. Still a little confused about which operating system is best for you or your organization? Check out the supplemental reading right after this video to learn more. There's one more thing I should call out. Remember that we have different CPU architecture's, 32-bit and 64-bit. Our operating systems will also be optimized for this architecture, so make sure that the CPU and OS are compatible. If you have a 64-bit CPU, you should also install the 64-bit version of the operating system you choose. Okay, now that you've chosen an operating system that you want to use, let's work on getting it installed on our hardware. Many computers come with an operating system pre-installed. If you boot the computer in this condition, the operating system will continue from whatever point the vendor left it at. You'll need to do a couple of things to finish the installation, like choosing a computer name, or host name, or configuring the network for the device. There's more, but we won't worry about that now. When we walk through an installation of an operating system, you'll be able to see this. If you're going to be installing an operating system from scratch, you can use different installation media. Some operating system manufacturers sell their operating system in disc form or USB form. Some let you do reinstalls directly over the internet. As an IT support specialist, you'll install an operating system many times, so using one single disk won't be time efficient or scalable. Scalability is an important concept that we'll cover later. If you want to scale or accommodate multiple computers, the added support is something you need to keep in mind. For now, you're only working with one computer so let's focus on that. Let's just use a USB drive to install your operating system. Some OS manufacturers have their own special USB drives with the installation image like Windows. For Linux we can load up an OS onto any USB drives. You'll see what I mean by that in the next couple of videos. See you there.

## 2. Virtual Machines

Before we start installing our operating system, we need to be familiar with the concept of Virtual Machines or VMs. A virtual machine is just a copy of a real machine. Why would you want that? We've been working with physical machines so far, but there are cases in IT support where we need access to a machine that isn't physically in front of us. Let's say I have a Windows machine and I want to learn another operating system like Linux. I don't want to buy another computer or have two separate operating systems on my disk. Instead, I can use an application like Virtual Box, to install Linux and have it completely isolated from my machine. Virtual machines use physical resources like memory, CPU and storage, but they offer the added benefit of running multiple operating systems at once. They're also easier to maintain and provision. Virtual machines have become a staple in many IT departments since they allow IT support specialists to create new virtual computers on-demand. They can also reclaim the resources they use when they're no longer needed. If you wanted to use software that's only available on one specific OS, it's easier to create a new virtual machine, use the software, and then delete the virtual machines once you're done. Throughout this program, you'll actually be using VMs to perform hands-on exercises. You'll be working on our quick labs platform, where you'll be presented tasks to complete from within a lab setting. We list out the specific tasks you'll need to complete. Once you complete the tasks, you'll get the credit for the lab. Okay. Now that we know what a virtual machine is, you can see how they can be extremely useful. We'll revisit the ends in the future and see there are other many uses. We're covering a lot of ground fast. Since we're going to start installing operating system soon, feel free to review these lessons to make sure you fully understand the fundamentals before moving on.

## 3. Installing Windows

The first operating system we're going to install is Windows 10 OS. This is the latest iteration in the Windows family operating system. If you buy the software in stores, it comes in a nifty USB drive. I have Windows loaded on a USB drive, I'm going to go ahead and start the drive, then boot it in a minute. But first, let's make sure we have our BIOS UEFI boot order, set to boot from the USB drive. Depending what the manufacturer of your computer uses, you'll either hit F12 or some other key to access the BIOS settings. Looks good. Let's just let it run and we'll see it booting from the USB drive. Take note that your installation process might be slightly different depending on the version of Windows. Okay, I'm just going to click Next here, just asking for my language preference, my time, and keyboard, then I'm going to click the Install now button. It's asking for product key, am just going to go ahead and skip this, do that later. And it's just asking me to agree to a software license term, so am just going to accept, next. All right, now it's asking which type of installation I want to do? I'm just going to click on custom, because I just want to install windows, I select the drive I want to install it on. Okay, looks like the computer restarted, now it's just configuring updates. Once it's done updating, it's going to restart one more time. And now, we're launched into the screen here that's asking us to enter in the product key. We're just going to go ahead and skip to this for now, we'll do this later, so am going to click, Do this later. And now, it's asking if what kind of settings we want to use? We're just going to click use express settings for now. So now, we start using our machine as quickly as possible. Okay, it's asking us to create an account for this PC. The first field is a user name. A user name is unique identifier for a user account. I'm just going to go ahead and use my first name as my username. Next, I'll enter a password. Once that's done, we'll go ahead and finish our setup. It's starting to set up everything for us, perfect. Now, here we are, inside the Windows 10 operating system. Check it out, this is our user space. We have our desktop environment here where we can navigate our files, folders, and applications. The main screen here is called a desktop. In the bottom right corner here, we have a task bar. This gives us quick options and shows us information like network connectivity, the date, system notifications, sound etc. In the bottom left hand corner here, we can access the applications, files, folders, and settings. You could also shut down, restart, and power off your computer from here. Let's move onto our system settings. In the main menu, go ahead and navigate to the settings. From here, you can change any of your system settings like display resolution, user accounts, network, devices, etc. Now, we're going to create a file in our operating system with our GUI. Let's create a file here on our desktop. All you need to do is right click, and you'll see some options available. Then select new, then text document, bam. Now we have a text file on our desktop. We just need to give it a name. How about my super cool file? And that's it. You just created a file on Windows. It wasn't so bad, was it?

## 4. Installing Linux

Now that we've seen how Windows is installed, let's go ahead and install the Linux operating system. Remember how I said that Linux has many different versions of their operating system called distributions? There are countless articles that highlights the pros and cons of the hundreds of distributions out there. We'll go with the most popular consumer distribution, Ubuntu. I've already loaded Ubuntu on a plain USB drive. ProTip: Since Ubuntu is open source, you can download the free operating system install image directly from their website and install it using whatever media you like. I've included a link to it in the next supplemental reading. I should also call out that you can't just copy the install file to a USB drive and expect it to work. It has to be copied in a way that makes a USB device bootable from our BIOS. To load the image onto your USB device and make it bootable, you can use a tool like etcher.io. You can also check out the link to the tool in the reading right after this video. Okay. Let me go power on. And remember, we're gonna make sure that we want to boot from the USB device. All right. Now that its loaded, you'll see an option if you want to try using the operating system first or just install the operating system. We're going to do a fresh install the operating system. The Ubuntu logo will pop up, and then we're going to have to go through a couple of loading screens while the system is installing. All right. We're just going to go ahead and skip through all of these and just pick the defaults for now. All right. Now it ask us for our name, a computer name, or host name, then a username. The host name is used to identify the computer when it needs to talk to other computers. On our personal computer, it's common to just use our own names for our computer's name. But in an IT organization, we want to choose a good host name that follows a certain standardization. We'll go over that in a later lesson, but for now, let's just use an industry standard for host name, like user name dash location. So I'm going to go and enter in my name, Cindy. Then, for the host name field, I'm going to type cindy-nyc. Then for the password, we're just going to enter a password here, then we're going to confirm. All right. Then, I'm going to hit next. And then it'll ask us to restart once it's done. Awesome. Now that's restarted, let's go ahead and log in. Great. Now we're in the Ubuntu desktop environment. Here you can see where applications are laid out. On the left-hand side here, we have a dock that we can add shortcuts to. This layout may change since Ubuntu is changing their desktop environment in the near future. To learn more about this, you can check out the next supplemental reading. On the top right-hand bar here, you'll see quick settings for your computer, like network connectivity, Bluetooth connectivity, sound and volume. There's also the time, a menu to power off, restart, sleep, and log out of your machine. Let's click on this menu and select "System Settings." From here, you can change your system settings, like your screensaver, resolution, hardware settings, and more. Let's go back to our desktop and select this icon here for files. This opens up a window so we can view our files. You can see the different files and folders here. If I click on "Computer", I'm taken to the main directory of my system. We're going to get to this in-depth in the later course. So for now, I'm going to head back to my desktop. Now, let's do the exact same thing we did with our windows machine and create a file. This time, let's just use commands in the shell. Because we're in a GUI, we don't have a program called Bash that we run our commands in. Instead, we open up the search utility here and search for an application called Terminal. When you open up the Terminal, you'll see your username, and at symbol, the host name, colon, tilde, and then slash desktop as your command prompt. This is used to show who's running the command. This will be more important in another course as you switch users. The last portion of the prompt shows you where you are on the computer. We'll learn more about this in a later lesson too. But you can see that we're currently in our desktop. You can verify that we're using the Bash shell with a simple command: echo dollar sign, SHELL. The echo command just prints out text options to the display. In this case, the argument ''dollar sign SHELL'' is the current shell, slash bin, slash bash or bash. You could even do ''echo Hello'', and it would display Hello, which isn't as useful. Okay. Let's create a file in our shell. I'm going to use the touch command. Touch my_super_cool_file. And here, you can see it made a file on our desktop. There are many different commands you can use to make a file, but the touch command in one of the simpler ones. Right now, it might be hard to understand why you have to memorize Linux shell commands when it's easier to use a Windows GUI. If you'd be working with any Linux machines, it's essential that you know these commands. Learning commands is also a stepping stone to process automation, which we'll cover in another course. Don't worry, by the end of this program, you should be super comfortable in the shell. Maybe you'll even run commands faster than you can in the GUI.

## 5. What is Chrome OS

We called out earlier that Chrome OS is an operating system based on Linux. Now, let's dive into how it's different from other Linux-based distributions. Unlike other operating systems, Chrome OS has one main purpose: to be a secure and simple way for the user to interact with the web. Not so long ago, the idea of having an operating system dedicated to running a web browser would've seemed weird like it was under using the computer. But today, you can do so much just through your web browser. You can communicate through email, create and share documents, edit photos and even connect remotely to another computer and the list continues to grow. The development of new web applications increases the number of things users can do all within the web browser. This means that for a lot of people, most of their daily computer use happens inside the browser. So, having an operating system built around a web browser makes a lot of sense. That said, Chrome OS is more than just a web-browsing operating system. It can also run Android and Linux applications inside containers. The user interface in Chrome OS is customized so you can only see the chrome interface. Process management, memory and input and output are still happening behind the scenes. But you don't need to deal with any of that. You only need to deal with the browser. Chrome OS machines come pre-installed with the operating system. So, there's nothing for us to install. When you log into a Chrome OS machine, you're also signing into the Chrome browser. Let's do that now. I've logged into my Chrome OS machine. It's pulling up my Chrome settings and extensions from the configuration stored in external servers provided by the Chrome infrastructure. This means that Chrome OS machines are interchangeable because most data is stored in the cloud, not locally. We'll learn more about the cloud in future lessons but for now think of the cloud as being somewhere else. Two other characteristics of Chrome OS are that it's extremely simple to use and very hard for users to meddle with. Since users don't have administrator rights on their Chrome OS machines, they won't be able to alter the system configuration. Also, Chrome OS has an automatic update mechanism that includes a fail-safe in case anything goes wrong. This means that the user doesn't need to worry about problems or hacks in the system because it's designed to stay up and running. Finally, Chrome OS has strong security, which we'll learn about in an upcoming course. For now, you just need to know that Chrome OS allows users to browse the web without worrying about malware and to share machines while keeping their data private. It also ensures that data won't be compromised if the machine is stolen. In short, there is no need to worry about harmful software that might be out there because Chrome OS defends against these threats. As an IT support specialist, you may find that some of the users in your organization will choose Chrome OS for their daily work. Since it's so easy to use and rarely breaks, we won't cover daily support in further detail.

## 6. Installing Mac OS

The last operating system we'll go over is Apple's Mac OS. We won't go into too many details about how to use this OS. Instead, we'll focus on the ins and outs of Windows and Linux OSs'. But if you know one operating system, you'll be able to navigate any operating system. Fortunately, all Apple computers come with Mac OS pre-installed, so we'll just go through the important parts of the operating system. Okay, here's the desktop environment for our Mac. At the bottom here, you'll see a doc with shortcuts to your applications. In the top right, you've got the system information like the time and date, network connectivity, battery life, if you have a laptop and some other quick settings. In the top left here, you can see the Apple icon. This bar will change menu options depending on what application is open. But if you click on the Apple icon, you'll see more options. You can tell your computer to Sleep, Restart and power off from here. The most important thing we want to look at is at the System Preferences menu item. This launches our system settings. From here, we can change any of our computer settings like setting the orientation of our mouse scroll, adding and removing users. Setting up printers, changing our screen savers, adding Bluetooth devices and more. I'm going to click on the desktop now. You'll notice our top-left setting changed from our System Preferences to Finder. Finder is the file manager for all Macs. If you open a new Finder window, you can navigate the files and folders on your Mac. If you right click on a file, or if you're using a Mac laptop you can use a two-finger click on a file to view more information and perform lots of different tasks. The Mac, which is a completely different operating system than Windows or Linux, operates in a very similar way, with similar menu options. Wow, you've really come a long way. You've been introduced to the major operating systems used today, gotten to play around with the system, and even performed some common tasks. Nice work. It's important in any IT role to know the ins and outs of operating systems, because you'll be interacting with them every single day. We have a separate course that teaches you all the essentials you need to navigate the Windows and Linux OSs'. But for now, pat yourself on the back. You just took the first step towards understanding OSs'. Installing, managing and navigating operating systems, are all tasks that you'll have to do daily as an IT support specialist. You may even find yourself doing this for hundreds, if not thousands of machines in your fleet one day. Before we send you to the next module, we have two assessments for you. Which will test you on creating files, with both Windows and Linux. You can always go back and review the videos again, if you need a refresher. Otherwise, I'll sign off for now, and we'll meet again in Course Three, Operating Systems and You, Becoming a Power User. In the next module, you'll meet my friend and colleague Victor Escobido who's going to dig into the Internet and networking.

## 7. Tri Ngo Obstacles _ How to be Successful in IT

The IT world is not that scary. So let me give a little example of where I'm from. So I'm from an underprivileged family who immigrated here to the U.S.. So I had a language barrier. Access to technology was also a barrier. I mean, back in the day I didn't have access to it and I worked hard to deal with all these obstacles. And right now I think people are quite lucky because there are economic opportunities. There is technological resources out there that are available on the Internet. A lot of them are in formats that people are more than willing to share their opinion, and share their solutions, and share their knowledge. So I think everyone's fortunate to have these resources available to them now. And I think that opens up opportunities to all of you. I think that it's okay to make mistakes. We're all human. It's okay to fail and then learn from those failures and not to give up. For example, when I launched a web page for my first job, there were a lot of errors that were showing up in the JavaScripts that I had written and everybody was able to see that you. I fixed them very quickly and in the end, I was able to produce something good and I was able to learn about troubleshooting and how to fix bugs on a webpage. And it was really quite beneficial.

## 8. Introduction to Qwiklabs

You're about to do a few exercises using the Qwiklabs online learning platform, powered by the Google Cloud console. Before we dive into that, let's learn a bit more about the platform. Qwiklabs is an online learning environment that takes you through live real-world scenarios, you may encounter as an IT Support specialist. Qwiklabs works with the Google Cloud Console, to spin up or create virtual machines. As we said earlier, a virtual machine or VM, simulates computers using software. This virtual machine will be running on either Linux or Windows, depending on the exercise. Qwiklabs supports both. This way you can learn to work in either operating system, regardless of which operating system you're running on your machine. The Qwiklabs virtual machines run in the cloud. So, you can access them over the internet from wherever you are. As we've shared before, when we say that a service is running in the cloud, we mean that it's running in a data center or on other remote servers. After this video, we'll give you instructions on how to access and complete the labs. You'll use Qwiklabs in lots of courses for this program. So spend some time learning your way around it. Each Qwiklab will create a temporary Google Cloud Console account, that expires when the lab ends. You'll need to repeat the login steps for every Qwiklab offered in this training, so that you can login with the newly created credentials each time. We still encourage you to try these exercises on a local machine, if that's an option for you. Remember that practice makes perfect, whether you're learning something new or trying to improve your skills. So practice using Qwiklabs as much as you can.

# Week 4

## 1. Module Introduction

Hi, my name is Victor Escobedo and I'm a Corporate Operations Engineer. I'm excited to spend the next of the lessons with you, before my colleague and friend Gian takes the reigns and wraps up the rest of the lessons on the Internet. Before we dive in though, I'd like to tell you a little bit about myself. My passion for IT began way back when I was nine years old and my dad brought home our first computer. He was a mechanical engineer and started using the computer to help him with his CAD work. This was the first time I was exposed to computers and later realized you can install new software on it, including computer games. As I tinkered with the computer, surely to my dad's dismay. I became more and more interested in how it worked and eventually started to open up the case and peek inside. I found pieces that could be removed and even some that shouldn't, learning through trial and error along the way. I couldn't really explain what it was, but I just found the mechanics of how it all worked together so fascinating. Looking back, these were the seeds that inspired my career. But you see, where I grew up, going to college and pursuing a career wasn't exactly talked about or heavily encouraged. I'm a first-generation Mexican-American, and there weren't a lot of people I knew pursuing a career in tech. My friends and family were mostly worrying about graduating high school and making sure they had jobs not really thinking about careers. My school didn't have the resources to offer many technical courses and even though my father was working in mechanical engineering, computers were a tool to him like a mill, ruler, or a hammer. My parents encouraged me to work hard and pursue computers but they couldn't really give advice about college or a career in tech. It's no real fault of their own, they just didn't have the necessary experience. When I decided to go to college, I decided to try my hand at computer science since it could feed my curiosity for how computers work at a more fundamental level. I realized that having this foundational knowledge really allowed me to understand some of the higher level concepts that were important in a career in tech. So while in school, I took on my first IT job for a local small company. I've been working in IT now for 12 years with the last 7 years being here at Google. I now work on managing deployments of large, internal IT projects for the company. Applying the knowledge I've picked up over the years in my initial IT help desk roles. To make sure I understand how I'm impacting our users and various support teams. Now that you know a little bit about me, let's dig into the Internet. The Internet made it possible for us to connect with almost anyone in the world. Before the Internet, you had to use paper maps and write down step-by-step directions to get where you wanted to go. If you wanted to see what your friends were up to, you'd have to call them, actually talk to them. If you wanted to learn something new, you had to go to a library and hope they have a book on the subject you wanted to learn. People didn't really discover new restaurants unless they heard about from someone else, or it was advertised. There was no Yelp or other website that rates restaurants like we have today. For some of us, life without the Internet seems unimaginable. We get it, it's become an integral part of our lives. In the next few lessons, you'll be learning about what the Internet is, how it came to be, and how it has impacted us both in negative and positive ways.

## 2. Basics of Networking

When most people think of the Internet, they think of a magical cloud that lets you access your favorite websites, shop online, and you're seemingly endless stream of cat pictures. But there isn't any magic involved. There's no mysterious entity that grants us a cat picture on demand. The Internet is just an interconnection of computers around the world, like a giant spider web that brings all of us together. We call the interconnection of computers a network. Computers in a network can talk to each other and send data to one another. You can create a simple network with just two computers. In fact, you might already have your own network at home connecting all of your home devices. Let's think on a bigger scale. What about the computers at your school or workplace? Are they in a network? They sure are. All of the computers there are linked together in a network. Can we link your home, school and workplace networks together? We absolutely can. Your workplace connects to a bigger network, and that network connects to an even bigger network, and on and on. Eventually, you've got billions of computers that are interconnected, making up what we call the Internet. You, like most people, probably access the Internet through a browser, like Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge or something else. This is done through the World Wide Web. But don't make the mistake of thinking the Internet is the World Wide Web. The Internet is the physical connection of computers and wires around the world. The Web is the information on the Internet. We use it to access the Internet through a link like www.google.com. The World Wide Web isn't the only way we can access the Internet. Your e-mail, chat, and file-sharing programs are also ways you can access the Internet. In the IT field, managing, building and designing networks is known as networking. Networking is a super important and large field in IT. There are specialized jobs, college degree programs, and tons of literature dedicated entirely to networking. If you work in the IT field, it's super critical that you understand the fundamentals of networking. So how does it all work? To answer that question, we're going to need a lot more time. Fortunately, we have a separate course entirely dedicated to this topic. We'll only cover the high-level overview of networking here. The Internet is composed of a massive network of satellites, cellular networks, and physical cables buried beneath the ground. We don't actually connect to the Internet directly. Instead, computers called servers connect directly to the Internet. Servers store the websites that we use, like Wikipedia, Google, Reddit, and BBC. These websites serve content. The machines that we use, like our mobile phones, laptops, video game, consoles and more, are called clients. Clients request the content, like pictures, websites, from the servers. Clients don't connect directly to the Internet. Instead, they connect to a network run by an Internet service provider or ISP, like CenturyLink, Level 3, Comcast, Telefonica, and things like that. ISPs have already built networks and run all the necessary physical cabling that connects millions of computers together in one network. They also connect to other networks and other ISPs. These other networks connect to the networks of Google, Reddit, and universities. Basically, all the other networks in the world, together, they form one giant network of computers called the Internet. But how do the clients know how to get to servers? Well, how would you send a letter to someone? You'd put your address on the letter and send it to the address of the person you're sending the letter to. Computers have addresses just like houses. Computers on a network have an identifier called an IP address. An IP address is composed of digits and numbers like 100.1.4.3. When we want to access a website like www.coursera.com, we're actually going to their IP address like 172.217.6.46. Devices that can connect to a network have another unique identifier called a MAC address. MAC addresses are generally permanent and hard-coded onto a device. A sample MAC address can be something like this. When you send or receive data through a network, you need to have both an IP and a MAC address. You might be wondering why we need to have two different numbers to identify something. That's a good question. Think again of the letter analogy we used before. An IP address is your house address, while the MAC address is the name of this recipient of the letter. He want to make sure your letter gets to the right location and to the right person. A more simplified example of the letter delivery would go like this. I'm in New York City, and I got a letter that I want to send to a friend, Mey. Mey is halfway across the world in Tokyo. So our letter will go through lots of places before it reaches her. I put her name and address on there, and I also put my name and address on there too. When I drop my letter off at the post office, the mail person looks at it. He thinks, "I don't know how to get to Tokyo from here, but there is a truck that's headed to Texas." He puts my letter in that truck. At the post office in Texas, a mail person looks at the letter and says, "I don't know how to get to Tokyo from here, but we have a truck going to San Francisco." She puts my letter in that truck. At the post office in San Francisco, yet another mail person looks at my letter. He says, "Oh, there's a plane headed to Tokyo." And puts the letter on that plane. When it finally reaches Tokyo, the postman there says, "Oh, I know where Mey lives," and delivers the letter to her. Obviously, there are many more nuance to mail delivery than what I described, but this process is similar to how information gets routed across the Internet. One thing to call out is that data that is sent through a network is sent through packets. There are little bits of data, and you guessed it, ones and zeros. It doesn't matter if it's pictures, email, music, or text. When we move data through the network, we break them down into packets. When a packet gets to its destination, it will rearrange itself back in order. Think of a packet like a letter. Let's actually look at this process again, but this time, we'll use IP addresses and MAC addresses. Natalie has a computer with IP address 113.8.81.2, and she wants to go to google.com and search for pictures of cats. Before she does that, her computer has to send a packet to ask google.com if it can access their website. Our packet knows google.com's IP address is 172.217.6.46, but it doesn't know how to get there just yet. The packet travels from one place to another at each destination, where it asks, "Hey, do you know where google.com is?" Eventually, it will be routed to another destination that can get the packet closer and closer to google.com. Once it reaches a destination that can deliver the packet to a server at google.com, Google will send Natalie a packet saying she can access an unlimited number of cat pictures. There are many technical details that we left out in this explanation, but don't worry. You'll learn all about the nitty-gritty in the networking course of this program. For now, this is what you need to know about the not so magic of the Internet.

## 3. Networking Hardware

Now that we understand what networks are, let's talk about how they're connected. There are a lot of ways you can connect computers to a network. We'll only cover a few of the major ones in this course. First, there is an Ethernet cable, which lets you physically connect to the network through a cable. On the back of the desktop we worked in the previous lessons, there's a network port that you plug your Ethernet cable into. Another way to connect to a network is through Wi-Fi, which is wireless networking. Most modern computing systems have wireless capabilities like mobile phones, smart televisions and laptops. We connect to wireless networks through radios and antennas. The last method will go over uses fiber optic cables to connect to a network. This is the most expensive method since fiber optic cables allow greater speeds than all the other methods. Fiber optic gets its name, because the cables contain glass fibers that move data through light instead of electricity. This means that we send ones and zeros through a beam of light instead of an electrical current, through a copper wire. How cool is that? But our cables have to connect to something. We don't just have millions of cables going in and out of computers to connect them together, instead, computers connect to a few different devices that help organize our network together. The first device that your computer connects to is a router. A router connects lots of different devices together and helps route network traffic. Let's say we have four computers, A, B, C and D, connected together through a router in the same network. You want to send a file from Computer A to Computer B. Our packets go through the router and the router utilizes network protocols, to help determine where to send the packet. We'll cover network protocols in the next video. For now, just know that our router uses a set of rules to figure out where to send our data. So, now our packet gets routed from Computer A to Computer B. What if you wanted to send a packet to a computer not in our network? What if we wanted to send a packet to our friend Alejandro's computer. Alejandro is on a different network altogether. Fortunately, our router knows how to handle that too. The packet will get routed outsider network to our ISP's network. Using networking protocols, it's able to figure out where Alejandro's computer is. During this process, our packet is traveling across many different routers switches and hubs. Switches and hubs are also devices that help our data travel. Think of switches like mailrooms in a building. Routers get our letters to the building. But once we're inside, we use the mailroom to figure out where to send a letter. Hubs are like company memos. They don't know who to send the memo to, so they send it to everyone. Working with network devices is important to understand, because it's likely that one day you'll have users reporting problems accessing the Internet. You want to investigate your way up the network stack. A technologies stack, in this case a network stack is just a set of hardware or software that provides the infrastructure for a computer. So, the networks stack is all the components that makes up computer networking. You might need to investigate the networks stack and your job. You'd start with making sure the end user computers are working properly. Then you'd turn your attention to other possible points of failure like the cabling, switches and routers, that work together to access the Internet. We'll dive a little deeper into the different networking devices in the Networking course. For now, let's route ourself to the next lesson, the language of the Internet.

## 4. Language of the Internet

We talked briefly about the networking protocols our devices use to help our packets get from one destination to another destination, but what are they? There are lots and lots of network protocols used and they're all necessary to help us get our packets in the right place. Think of network protocols like a set of rules for how we transfer data in a network. Imagine if you sent a letter to your friend Sasha who lives in California, but your post office sends it out to another Sasha who lives out in New York. That would hopefully never happen, since the post office has rules that they follow to make sure your letter is sent to the correct address. Our networking protocols do the same thing. There are rules that make sure our packets are routed efficiently, aren't corrupted, are secure, go to the right machine and are named appropriately. You get the idea. We'll cover specific network protocols later on, but there are two protocols that you need to know. The Transmission Control Protocol and the Internet Protocol, or TCP/IP for short, which have become the predominant protocols of the Internet. The Internet Protocol or IP, is responsible for delivering our packets to the right computers. Remember those addresses that computers use to find something on a network? They're called IP addresses or Internet protocol addresses. The Internet Protocol helps us route information. The Transmission Control Protocol or TCP, is a protocol that handles reliable delivery of information from one network to another. This protocol was an important part of the creation of the internet since it let us share information with other computers. We'll spend a lot of time diving into these protocols in the next course, the bits and bytes of computer networking, so stay tuned. For now, you've got a high level understanding of how the internet works with TCP/IP.

## 5. The Web

There are lots of different ways to use the Internet, we all know that. But I want to cover one of the more prevalent ways that people access the Internet, through the Web. All websites can be accessed through the Web. Websites are basically text documents that we format with HTML, or hypertext markup language. It's a coding language used by web browsers. Web pages are generally made up of very basic components. They contain multimedia content like text, images, audio and video. When you want to navigate to a website, you would type in a URL like www.reddit.com. A URL, which stands for Uniform Resource Locator, is just a web address similar to a home address. Notice the www in the URL? It stands for World Wide Web. The second portion, reddit.com, is something we call a domain name. Anyone can register a domain name. It's just our website name. Once a name is taken, it'll be registered to ICANN, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers. Once a domain name is registered with ICANN, no one else can take that name unless it becomes available again. The last part of the URL in this case is .com. But you can also use different domain endings like reddit.net or reddit.org. The different domain name endings are standards for what type of website it might be. So a domain that ends in .edu is mainly used for educational institutions. Remember how computers use IP addresses to find another computer? Well, you can do the same if you wanted to find a computer on the Internet. Let's go ahead and type 172.217.6.46 into a web browser and hit Enter. Wait a minute. What happened? How come we're at Google's homepage? It turns out the IP address, 172.217.6.46 maps to Google's homepage through a critical web protocol, Domain Name System, or DNS. DNS acts like our Internet's directory and lets us use human readable words to map to an IP address. The computer doesn't know what google.com is. It only knows how to get to an IP address. With DNS, it's able to map Google's IP address with google.com. Every time you go on a website, your computer is performing a DNS lookup to find the IP address of the website name you typed in. This trick can be a good first step in diagnosing certain kinds of DNS issues. So if you're able to access a website by its IP address but not its human readable domain name, then there's a good bet that there's probably a problem somewhere in the DNS configuration your network is using. Understanding IP addresses can come in handy in all sorts of other situations you might encounter as an IT support specialist. The source of Internet requests are usually identified by IP addresses and server logs. Many pieces of IT infrastructure need to have some kind of IP address configuration applied to them in order to work. DNS is a huge system, and we'll be discussing more about it later. Now that you understand the basics of how the Internet works, I'll sign off for now, and leave you in the very capable hands of my friend and colleague, Gian Becuza. I'll see you again in course two, The Bits and Bytes of Computer Networking. But in the next lessons, Gian is going to talk about the incredible boom of the Internet age.

## 1. History of the Internet

You’ve learned what the Internet is and a little bit about how it works. Now, we’re going to take a step back and learn why it was created. But before we do that, I’d like to introduce myself. My name is Gian Spicuzza and I'm a program manager in Android security. I help protect Android's 2 billion plus users by managing new security features for each of Android's desserts or versions of Android. I've always loved technology and I worked in IT since I was 16 and throughout university. I would fill my pastime reading about new tech and building servers from old computer parts in my basement. My earliest memory of working on tech is waiting for my parents to go to sleep so I could quietly dial up the Internet while the phone was free and just browse websites all night long and read about random tech things. My first jobs were as a one person IT crew at three nonprofit organizations. It was both stressful and really exciting to be responsible for everything. From configuring and administrating backup servers, to just showing new employees how to access email and use their computers. I'm really excited to be here with you. I was never a really great test taker, and my grades reflected that. But I knew with hard work and perseverance, I could build a great career in IT, and so can you. So let's get started and dig in a bit more on the Internet. The Internet has become an essential part of our lives. Our bank accounts, entertainment, news and education are all on the Internet. It's important to learn why that is, since some of the original designs of the Internet have reached their limitations. As an IT support specialist, you should understand what the future of the Internet holds and why. Let's go back in time to the 1950s where it all started. Remember, back then computers were huge and bulky. If you were a programmer, you needed to directly interact with these massive computers. That would get real old real fast, especially if you had several people who wanted to use the only computing resource available. In the late 1960s, the US government spun up a project called DARPA. It went on to create the earliest version of the Internet that we see today with the ARPANET. Eventually, computer programmers were able to share a single computing resource by being able to remotely access the computer. But there was still a big problem. Networks couldn't talk to each other. It wasn't until the 1970s that we had a critical breakthrough in computer networking that fixed this problem. It was thanks to computer scientists Vinton Cerf and Bob Kahn, who created the method we call the Transmission Control Protocol and the Internet Protocol, or TCP/IP. First, only a handful of computers in universities, governments, and businesses adopt TCP/IP, then hundreds. And then, in the span of 50 years, billions of computers. TCP/IP is the protocol we use on the Internet today. Finally, people around the world could send data to one another, but there was still a problem. The information they sent was just text. It wasn't centralized and it was pretty bland. Then, in the 1990s, a computer scientist by the name of Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web. It utilized different protocols for displaying information in webpages and became the predominant way of communication in accessing the Internet. Anyone who had an Internet connection at that time was able to access the information source of the World Wide Web. It's been 30 years since the creation of the World Wide Web. We've gone from sending simple email messages and viewing basic webpages to having video chats and instant news updates. Order food, buy books, and even cars in a matter of seconds. Taking an online course like this wasn't even possible until recently. The creation of the Internet that we know today was a culmination of knowledge and engineering from many brilliant scientists and organizations. If you want to learn more about the history of the Internet, check out the supplemental reading and the networking course in this program. In the next video, we'll explore the limitations of the original designs of the Internet and how these limitations affect us today.

## 2. Limitations of the Internet

We've mentioned IP addresses a lot in this course but we haven't actually gone into detail about them. They are actually different versions of IP addresses. The current Protocol, Internet Protocol version four or IPv4 is an address that consists of 32 bits separated into four groups. Remember, 42 bits is four bytes and one byte can be stored up to 256 values from 0 to 255. So IPv4 addresses, can be something like 73.55.242.3. Even though it might seem like a lot of possible IPv4 addresses, there are less than 4.3 billion IPv4 addresses. There are way more than 4.3 billion websites out on the web today. Some IPv4 addresses are even reserved for special purposes. So, the number of usable IP addresses is even less. A device that wants to connect to the internet, needs to have an IP address but devices around the world have already exceeded those numbers. So, where have we been getting IP addresses? IP addresses have been able to keep up with the amount of devices in the world, thanks to IPv6 or Internet Protocol version six addresses. IPv6 addresses consist of a 128 bits, four times the amount that IPv4 uses. Which means way more devices can have IP addresses. The adoption of IPv6 addresses has been slow but steady. Eventually, you will start seeing more and more IPv6 addresses in the wild. An example IPv4 for address can be something like 172.14.24.1. But an IPv6 address can be something like what you see here, quite a bit of a difference, don't you think? Here's an analogy for how big this difference is between IPv4 and IPv6. With IPv6 there are 2 to the 128 power possible IP addresses, 2 to the 128 power is an insanely huge number. So huge, that scientists had trouble describing with words just how big this number is. So, here's an analogy. Think of a grain of sand, if you scoop up a handful, do you know how many grains you have in your hand? Probably a lot but that is not even close to the number we are talking about. Now, take all the grains of sand in the entire world, assuming there are roughly 7 and a half times 10 to the 18th power grains of sand in the world. That still would not be enough IPv6 addresses. Now, let us take all the sand from multiple earths, now you are close to what that number would be. It is a crazy large number. Just know that we will not be running out of IPv6 addresses anytime soon. Another mitigation tool that we have been able to use is NAT or Network Address Translation. This lets organizations use one public IP address and many private IP addresses within the network. Think of NAT like a receptionist at a company. You know what number to dial to get to the company and once you reach the receptionist, he can transfer your call to one of the private numbers inside the company. Now, instead of companies using hundreds of public IP addresses, they can just use one IP address. Remember the routers we talked about earlier? One task you might need to perform when you are an I.T. support specialist, is to configure NAT on a router to facilitate communication between your company's network and the outside world. There are lots of other limitations that we have had to deal with. You'll learn more about them in the networking course. For now, you should have a general understanding of why IPv4 is so limiting for us today and how IPv6 helped solve that.

## 1. Impact

There's no doubt that the Internet has made it much easier for us to connect with our friends and family. But it's also made it easier to connect with everyone else in the world. We're no longer confined to our local neighborhoods. Decades ago, If you wanted to sell something you'd place your goods in your driveway, and put up signs for a garage sale. The only way someone would see this is if they drove by your neighborhood and saw your sign. We got a little more savvy and started advertising in our local newspaper. We had to pay to list our ad, but at least we were able to reach more people in our neighborhood. Then the Internet boom happened, and we could use sites like Craigslist to post an advertisement for free, and reach more people in our city. Then we were able to sell to people outside of our city, to cities in other states. Eventually, we could sell to people outside of our own country, all thanks to the Internet. Globalization is the movement that lets governments, businesses, and organizations communicate and integrate together on an international scale. It's been made possible by the Internet and information technology. Countries can communicate with each other faster. News happening on the other side of the world reaches us before we can blink. And global and financial trade have increased dramatically. Globalization has transformed almost every aspect of human society as we know it. Media and social movements have become globalized too. In 2011, several countries in the Middle East started riots and protests against their government regimes, known as the Arab Spring protests. Because of outlets like social media, their movement gained worldwide attention and citizens of many different countries banded together to take collective action. Social media movements like this have been going on for years, gathering together people from all over the world and unifying them under a single cause. The Internet has also dramatically changed the way we consume entertainment. A few years ago if you wanted to watch something on TV you had to actually sit in front of your TV right when it aired, or else you'd miss it. Then we started recording our shows, first on VHS and then on things like TiVo, so we could watch them later. But now, we have access to more TV shows and movies than we can ever watch in our entire lifetime right under fingertips. What if you wanted to listen to a new song by your favorite band? You used to have to wait until they released their album in a store, and you couldn't just buy one song, you had to buy the entire album on a CD, cassette tape, or even a vinyl record back in the day. If you wanted to get the day's news you had to wait until the next day when the newspaper would print it. Even then you weren't able to get a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of the news you can get on the Internet today. Retail stores aren't the only place you look when you want to buy something anymore. Now you can order food, clothes, books, and while just about anything on the Internet. But you don't just buy stuff off the web, you can even get an education. Colleges and universities worldwide are taking education out of the classroom and putting it into your homes. Online courses are becoming a popular way for people to get a quality education at a more convenient location, time, and price. And it's not just degrees, there's an almost infinite amount of educational tools available on the Internet. A few years ago, all this information on the internet had to be reached through your laptop or desktop. Now more than ever, people are going mobile and can access all of this information with their smartphones. It's truly an amazing time to be alive in this technological age. So, the takeaway here is that the only constant in the field of technology is change. And as an IT support specialist you'll have to stay on your toes to keep up with this dynamic shifting landscape.

## 2. Internet of Things

You may have heard of the phrase Internet of Things or IoT. This concept is pretty new but already has a major impact on the future of computing. The concept is fairly simple. Basically, more and more devices are being connected to the internet in a smarter fashion. Did you know that there are now smart thermostats? Instead of manually programming them when you'll be out of the house, they'll just know when you leave and turn off the air conditioning for you. And it's not just your thermostat, many companies out there are making smarter household devices. There are fridges that can keep track of what foods you have in their, toasters that can be controlled by your smartphone, lights that can change depending on your mood and cars that drive you instead of you driving them. The world is moving towards connecting manual devices to the internet and making them smarter. These decisions have many societal implications though, especially when it comes to cybersecurity or personal privacy. But there's also a huge potential for IoT to completely transforme the world in ways we have yet to see. In the future, people may be shocked to learn that we had to do manual things like, make your own coffee or drive to the grocery store. While you may not experience working with an Internet of Things device, you should be aware that it will become a large part of the future of computing. You can learn more about IoT in the next supplementary reading.

## 4. Privacy and Security

The added convenience made possible by the Internet also makes it harder and harder for us to maintain anonymity. When you purchase something online, your buying habits can be logged, and you may be targeting with marketing. Even when you want to do something simple, like book a dinner reservation, your name, phone number, email, and maybe even a credit card number are required. Now think about the information you post publicly. Name, pictures, family, friends, and even your location, may be available to anyone online. Be aware of what you're sharing by reviewing the privacy policy of a service before you use it. It's up to you to decide if the trade-offs of a service are worth sharing your personal information. In most cases, companies are trying to build great products that make our lives easier. They may offer their products for free because you provide them with free data. Just make sure your information won't fall into the wrong hands. Privacy doesn't just affect us on a personal scale, it's also become a concern for governments. In Europe, data regulation and privacy are strictly protected to help EU citizens gain more control over their personal information. COPPA, or the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, also regulates the information we show to children under the age of 13. There are many more examples of government regulation of privacy. It's no longer something we can think of on an individual scale. Another concern that's grown with the rise of the Internet is the issue of copyright. Imagine you create a beautiful graphic and upload it on the web for your friends to see. Then some random stranger takes your graphic, claims it as their own, and sells it for profit. Thankfully, several companies have been founded and designed specifically to help solve this issue of copyright and intellectual property theft. There are also efforts in place that you've learned about, like open source projects, that benefit from being on the Internet. In these cases, open collaboration allows the project to thrive. On top of privacy and copyright considerations, computer security is another issue that you may face in both your personal and professional life. More and more companies are being targeted in cyber security attacks. For example, the WannaCry Attack that started in Europe, infected hundreds of thousands of computers across the world. The financial loss of that attack has been estimated at over a billion dollars. Hospital computers were even infected. In a critical life threatening moment, every second matters. Not being able to perform basic medical duties, like pulling medical records, took time away from doctors and nurses and more importantly the lives of their patients. Before the WannaCry Attack, there were lots of other world wide attacks. In 2011, the Sony PlayStation network was attacked and around 77 million user accounts had personal information exposed, everything from entire governments to businesses that handle the data of millions of people have been compromised. Computer security is no longer the job of specialized security engineers, it's everyone's responsibility, and as an IT support specialist, you'll need to have a fundamental understanding of computer security. You'll get to learn these fundamentals in the course IT Security, Defense Against the Digital Dark Arts, which I'll be teaching you. I spend every day working in security. I love working in the field, because I get to help protect people and their devices from all over the globe. The security course in this program teaches you just that. You'll also learn what threats are out there and how you can prevent and mitigate them and how to secure your workplace. Next up, you're going to meet my buddy, Phelan Vendeville, who's going to introduce you to software. But before that we've got a quick quiz we've cooked up for you on all the topics we've covered so far. Take your time, and good luck.

## 5. Heather Adkins Keeping Hacker_s out

My name is other Heather Adkins. I'm Director of Information Security and Privacy here at Google. And our job is to keep the hackers out. Every day at Google for me is a new day. It's like a new job every day. Hackers are very interesting and very diverse in the way that they do things. They're either hacking for fun and fame because they're intellectually curious and they want to understand how things work, or they're hacking for money because they want to steal money from people, or they're hacking because they want to steal information. And so, for us, we try to understand how the hackers work so that we can understand what kinds of things we have to do to prevent them from doing it. You have to understand how the internals work. You have to understand how the programmer built it. And this is really thrilling. You get to write alongside the programmer and understand what they were thinking when they were designing the software and anticipate what mistakes they might have made. So, we prepare for being hacked by understanding how hacking works. And this is often the most exciting part of our work because we get to break the systems. And I think a lot of us who get into the field think what, "Would it be like to rob a bank? What would it be like to hack into a system?" Here, we get to play the other side of that. So, we have hackers of our own who hack our systems and tell us how they did it. And we also study how the actual attackers in the world are hacking other people. I think that the field of security is so exciting for us, those of us who do it as a profession, because it's changing all the time. That presents us with new challenges every single day. And it also appeals to us, I think, because it means that we're protecting users. Google has a service offered to billions of people on the planet. And we do it because we want to protect them.

# Week 5

## 1. Module Introduction

Hi, my name's Phelan Vendeville and I'm a Systems Engineer in the Site Reliability Organization at Google. I'm really excited to be your instructor for the next few lessons. Before we jump in, I'll kick things off by telling you a little bit about myself. My passion for technology began in high school, which was located in a geographically isolated part of California. This isolation meant that technology and the internet played an important role in bringing the outside world to students and connecting them with ideas and opportunities via things like virtual field trips and promote learning. For example, I remember preparing for the SATs through digital classroom sessions, which would have been impossible to attend in person. After high school, I enlisted in the US Navy as an Information Systems Technician responsible for maintaining computer and network systems. I continued to witness the ways technology brings people together. Whether that meant coordinating ship movements during training exercises or connecting love ones on long deployments via video chat. Lots of people use technologies in various ways every day, but relatively few understand how it works. A career in IT can be challenging, as I can attest to personally. I can still remember the horror I felt after blowing up the power supply of a master ship's computer, by using the wrong voltage switch. But a career in IT can be incredibly rewarding, when you can do things like recover irreplaceable family photos from a failing hard drive. As an IT Support Specialist, you'll be in a position to not only know how a given piece of technology functions, but also how to help fix it when it breaks. This means you'll have a direct impact on the flow of information going between people, which is pretty cool. I'm excited to teach you about the third layer of computer architecture known as software. Software is how we, as users, directly interact with our computer. The operating system that we interact with is just software. The music programs, word processors and more that we use every day are also software. But what exactly is it? If the hardware is the physical stuff that you can pick up and hold, software is the intangible instructions that tell the hardware what to do. In the next lesson, we're going to deep dive more into what software is, how we install it, and how it works.

## 2. What is Software

Video games, music players, and internet browsers are all different types of software that have completely different functions. Think of the apps on your phone and your laptop. We spend a lot of time interacting with this type of software but we may not know how it actually works or gets added to our systems. In the last few videos, we learned about networking and the internet. There are tons of applications out there that require the Internet to work. Think about it. Your social media apps, messaging apps, and others run off the Internet. This Internet integration isn't just magically added to your application, it's built-in to require it to function. Before we go too far into the world of software, I want to call out some common terms related to software that you might hear. Coding, scripting, and programming are all terms that might seem a little blurry. They generally refer to the same thing but they each have small distinctions. Coding is basically translating one language to another. This can be coding from English to Spanish, English to Morse code or even English to a computer language. When someone builds an application, we refer to it as coding an application. Scripting is coding in a scripting language. We'll talk about scripting languages in a later lesson but scripts are mainly used to perform a single or limited range task. There are languages we can use to build these. Programming is coding in a programming language. Programming languages are special languages that software developers use to write instructions for computers to execute. Larger applications like your web browser, text editors, and music players are all usually written in programming languages. When we use the term software, it generally refers to something that was programmed. We'll use these terms pretty interchangeably so don't sweat the details, now onwards and upwards. So, what is software made of and who builds it? That's a great question. Anyone who knows a programming or a scripting language can use it to write code. There's a huge demand for this skill set and it's becoming easier for someone to learn to code. If you're going to be working in IT, it's important that you understand how software works and how it gets installed on your systems. You might encounter software errors or just good old fashioned failures and you need to understand how to deal with them. By the end of this module, you'll be able to understand what software is, how it works, and how to install it, remove it and update it, all within the Linux and Windows operating systems.

## 3. Types of Software

When you rate content, create a piece of art, or engineer something, your work is protected for your use and distribution. There's usually some other caveats depending on the laws in your country but in general, copyright is used when creating original work. Software that is written is also protected by copyright. Software developers can choose what they do with their software. For commercial software, it's common to let someone else use their software, if they pay for a license. For non-commercial software, a popular option is making it open-source. This means the developers will let other developers share, modify, and distribute their software for free. Score. Some amazing software efforts have been developed in advance because of open source. One major example is the Linux kernel which is used in the Android OS and in enterprise and personal computers. Hundreds of millions of devices are running Linux at this very second LibreOffice, GIMP, and Firefox are other examples of open source software. Open source projects are usually contributed by developers who work on the project for free in their free time. These massive software development efforts were essentially built by a community of volunteers. How great is that? In I.T. environment, you'll have to pay special attention to the types of software you use. Some may require you to pay multiple licenses to use it, others may be free and open source. It's important to check the license agreement of any software before you install it. We've talked about some of the basics of software, but now let's shift to the two types of software you'll encounter categorized by function. Application Software is any software created to fulfill a specific need, like a text editor, web browser, or graphics editor. System software is software used to keep our core system running, like operating system tools and utilities. There's also a type of system software that we haven't defined yet, called firmware. Firmware is software that's permanently stored on a computer component. Can you think of a firmware that we've talked about already? If you thought of the BIOS, you're right. The BIOS helps startup the hardware on your computer and also helps load up your operating system. So it's important that it's in a permanent location. I should also call out software versions. These are important because they tell us what features were added to a specific software iteration. You'll encounter lots of software versions while you work with software. Developers might sometimes use a different standard when distinguishing a version. But in general, the majority of versions follow a sequential numbering trend. You might see something like this, 1.2.5 or 1.3.4, which of these do you think is the newer version? It's 1.3.4 because it's a larger number than 1.2.5. You can read more about software versioning in the supplemental reading. You'll have to work with all kinds of software. Fortunately, it basically all works the same way. Once you learn how one piece of software works, you'll understand how others might function. We're going to learn how in the next few videos.

## 4. Revisiting Abstraction

Earlier in this course, we talked about how programs are instructions that are given to a CPU. We can send binary code or bits to our CPU, then they'll use an instruction set to run those commands. But these CPUs might be from different manufacturers and may have different instructions. There might even be all kinds of different hardware components, like video cards and hard drives, that also have their own special interfaces. So how do we write a program that the hardware can understand? Well, one way would be to write a program for each possible combination of CPU and hardware using the native languages and interfaces of these components. But there are potentially millions of possible configurations of hardware. So how do we get anything to work with all these complex and diverse hardware? Well, thanks to the efforts of computer scientists and the principle of abstraction, we can now use programming languages to write instructions that can be run on any hardware.

## 5. Recipe for Commputing

Remember that in the 1950s, computer scientists use punch cards to store programs. These punch cards represented bits that the CPU would read and then perform a series of instructions based on what the program was. The binary code, could look like this, and the instructions would be translated to this. Grab some input data from this location in memory, using the input data, do some math, then put some output data into this location in memory. But storing programs on punch cards was a long and tedious task. The programs had to be kept on stacks and stacks of punch cards. Computer scientists needed a better way to send instructions to a machine, but how? Eventually, a language was invented called Assembly language, that allowed computer scientists to use human readable instructions, assembled into code that the machines could understand. Instead of generating binary code, computer scientists could program using machine instructions, it is like this, take integer from register one, take integer from register two, add integer from register one and register two and output to register four. This example makes it look like a human can read it, but don't be fooled. Let's take an example of saying something simple like, hello world, in Assembly language. It looks pretty robotic. Don't get me wrong, that's still an improvement over it's binary code cousin. But Assembly language will still register thin veil from machine code. It's still didn't let computer programmers use real human words to build a program. And a program that was written for a specific CPU, could only be run on that CPU or family of CPUs. A program was needed that could run on many types of CPUs. Enter compiled programming languages. A compiled programming language uses human readable instructions, then sends them through a compiler. The compiler takes the human instructions and compiles them into machine instructions. Admiral Grace Hopper, invented this back in 1959, to help make programming easier. Compilers are a key component to programming, and helped to pave the road that led us to today's modern computing. Thanks to compilers, we can now use something like this, and it will be the same thing as this. Computer scientists have developed hundreds of programming languages in the past couple of decades to try and abstract the different CPU instructions into it's simpler commands. Along the way, another type of language emerged that was interpreted rather than compiled. Interpreted languages aren't compiled ahead of time. A file that has code written in one of these languages is usually called a Script. The script is run by an interpreter, which interprets the code into CPU instructions just in time to run them. You'll learn how to write code using a scripting language later in this program. As an IT support specialist, scripting can help you by harnessing the power of a computer to perform tasks on your behalf, allowing you to solve a problem once and then move on to the next thing. Programming languages are used to create programs that can be run to perform a task or many tasks. There are lots of types of programs and in the next lesson, we'll talk about how to manage them.

## 1. Managing Software

Programs, software, and applications, are terms that are synonymous with each other. For now we'll go ahead and use the term software to refer to any of these. We've already had a rundown of the different types of software. There are certain types of software that perform specific functions, like drivers, which allow us to interact with our hardware. There are applications that we use for our day to day job functions. And there are utilities that we use like a calculator, settings, and other tools. With the seemingly endless options for software, how do we know which ones to use? How do we deal with them in a workplace setting and in our personal lives? Software is always changing. Developers are releasing updates, software companies change, features are added, and so on. This constant change is completely out of our control and it can cause a lot of headaches in the IT world. Let's say the company that builds your payroll system pushes out a software update that causes settings to change or even worse completely breaks the compatibility with your own company. It can happen. You should always test new software before letting your company use it. Another thing to worry about is old software. When you run old software on your machine, you risk being exposed to cyber security attacks that take advantage of software bugs. A software bug is an error in software that causes unexpected results. We'll deep dive into computer security in a later course. For now, know that software updates usually contain critical security updates and new features, and have better compatibility with your system. A good guideline is to update your software constantly. Another problem that plagues the IT world when it comes to software is software management. If you're setting up a computer for someone, you want to make sure that they'll have all the necessary tools they need to hit the ground running. That means you'll need to install all the software required for the job. That also means you'll also want to remove software that isn't required for the job. We may not realize if a piece of software we installed is malicious software which causes harm to your computer. It's always a good idea to check if the software comes from a repudible source before you install it. A common industry practice is to not allow users to install software without administrator approval. This prevents users from installing unwanted software because they're actually blocked with an error message that says they need an administrator to enter their login credentials. Before we get too far ahead of ourselves, let's cover the basics of software management which include installing, updating, and removing software. In the videos up next, we're going to walk through how to do these steps in a Windows environment and a Linux environment. Ready, set, go.

## 2. Installing, Updating and Removing Software on Windows

Get ready because in this video we're going to install a program called Git. Git is a version control system that helps keep track of changes made to files and directories. Like how some word processors today have a revision history feature, if you didn't like something you wrote, you can just go back to a previous version. First, we're going to grab the install program from Git's website. We're going to download the 64-bit executable. Remember from an earlier lesson that we're using a 64-bit CPU architecture. So we should install 64-bit applications for better compatibility. Next up, you'll see the file extension .exe. This is a little different than the text or image file extensions we've seen up until now. exe is a file extension found in Windows for an executable file. We'll learn more about this in a later lesson two. For now, just double-click on this and it will ask us if we want to install the file. Voila, that's it. Now you can start using it. Some program installations might ask you to reboot. Make sure to do that since there might be some system files or processes that also need to restart for your new software to work correctly. To verify that you now have Git installed, you can navigate to Add or remove programs. From here, you can see what applications are installed on the machine, and there it is, Git version 2.14.1. Let's say you had an older version of Git installed and you wanted to update it to the new version. Luckily, Windows makes it easy for us to do just that. We can install it just like we did, and it'll ask if we want to upgrade to the newest version. To remove software from Windows, you can just search for the Add or remove programs setting. From there, select the application you want to remove, and you'll see a button to Uninstall. Let's go ahead and click this, and run through an uninstall of the software. It asks us for an administrative password. We have safety guards in place to prevent unauthorized users from installing or uninstalling software. We'll learn more about this later, but for now, since I'm an administrator, I'm just going to enter my password and uninstall the software. Once you uninstall software, restart your computer so we can do the necessary cleanup to completely get rid of it

## 3. Installing, Updating and Removing Software on Linux

Now that you know how to install, update, and remove software on Windows, let's do the same for Linux. Let's navigate back to the git download page. Under the Linux page, you'll actually see many different ways to install git. This is because the different Linux distributions use different package installers. Since we're using Ubuntu, we're just going to use this command; apt, install git. Apt is the command we use in Ubuntu's package manager and the install option will let us install something. Let's go ahead and run this in our terminal. We're getting an error that says permission denied. Like Windows when we install something on our machine, we need to tell the computer that we're authorized to install software. Right now, we can preface this command with another Linux command. Sudo which stands for super user do. It asks us for a password. So, let's add that in. We're getting a lot of output. It's just asking if we want to continue installing this application and since we do, I'm going to say why and enter. To update a package, you do the exact same thing as we just did and install a newer software version. To remove a package, we could also use a command pretty similar to the install command except this time we want to remove a package. This asks us if we want to continue with these changes. Let's go ahead and type why and enter. That's it. Now you know how to install, update, and remove software on Linux and Windows. Nice work.

## 4. Software Automation

You're doing awesome. By now you've learned what software is, how it integrates with our computer, and how we manage it. It was easy to install, update, and remove software on one machine. But what if you had to do that for multiple machines? That would take up a lot of time. If only there was a way we could have it done automatically for us. Spoiler alert, there is. We use software to help us with this. There are lots of tools out there that help make managing computers easier. We use automation for this. Automation makes processes work automatically. You can even use the tools of automation like programs and scripts to help you with troubleshooting issues. So instead of reading hundreds of lines of log files manually to discover when a particular error occurred on a computer, you could write a script to read the log for you and print out only the relevant line, we'll learn a lot more about automation later. Just know that software has many uses including making processes more efficient and easier. You made it all the way through software, nice work. We'll meet again in course five, IT Automation, it's not that scary, really it's not. I'm excited to show you the power of automation and teach you some of the actual coding in Ruby. Next, you'll meet Marty Clark, she's your instructor for troubleshooting and will talk to you about how good customer service is critical to IT support. In the meantime, work hard, soak up a ton of knowledge, and have some fun along the way. I'll see you back here later on.

# Week 6

## 1. Module Introduction

You've already learned about the hardware, operating systems, and software layers of the computer architecture model. Now it's time to learn about the most important layer, the user layer. Troubleshooting problems and solid communication with users, maybe one of the most challenging parts of your job as an IT support specialist. But by the end of this module, you'll know the best way to handle them. Fixing problems and creating positive interactions with people, are two fundamental skills that can be applied to almost any situation in the IT world and beyond. Knowing how to analyze an issue, identifying the causes and effects, and use the information to find potential solutions are skills that everyone from I.T. support specialists, to doctors can use. Hi, I'm Marti Clark, and I'm a manager with Google's internal I.T. support program. Even though I grew up around technology and worked at my university's helpdesk, going into tech wasn't something that was encouraged by my teachers or my family. Now, as a manager, I try to encourage all techs I work with to follow their passion. It's this passion that help others grow, and my love for technology that led me here. Helping people with technology is both a rewarding and challenging endeavor. I encourage my team to take advantage of their work with users, to spin up ideas, solutions, and opportunities for improvement. The technical aspects of problem solving are super useful. But don't forget the real reason most technology exists, is to improve people's lives. Rather it's the routing algorithm that form the backbone of the Internet or the software tools that let people create amazing art, the ways that people interact with technology are central to IT. As an I.T. support specialist, you're uniquely positioned to combine technology and people know how to make those interactions better, and make a difference in people's day to day lives.

## 2. Ask Questions!

How would you respond if I asked you, "Do you know how long it'll take me to get to the bank?" You'd probably ask, "Where are you?" "Where's the bank?" "Are you walking, driving, biking?" But if you just guess the details of my situation to direct me to the bank, your response would be a day late and a dollar short. It seems like such a natural thing to ask questions and gather information to solve a problem, but it's usually one of those most overlooked steps in troubleshooting. Troubleshooting is the ability to diagnose and resolve a problem. One of the most difficult skills to acquire in an IT role isn't technical knowledge, but effective troubleshooting, whether that's helping someone face-to-face or remotely. It's not specific to the IT world either. We use troubleshooting skills every day. My car is broken. The light bulb went out. I feel sick. Imagine if you went to your doctor and said, "I feel sick," and without any other information, he gives you a prescription for allergy medicine. Time to find a new doctor. While this might seem far-fetched, this can happen pretty often in the IT world. We're so in the habit of fixing things that sometimes, we try to fix something without diagnosing it first. We're going to give you the tools you need to develop good troubleshooting habits. No matter how big or small the problem is, the first thing to do in troubleshooting is ask questions. There are a lot of factors that can cause a problem. You want to make sure you gather all your data before you start to tinker with it. Over the next several videos, we're going to demonstrate real world, in-person, and remote troubleshooting scenarios. For the in-person scenarios, you'll meet Gail and Marty. And yes, we have another Marty joining us, but he spells his name with a Y, and I spell mine with an I. Confusing, I know. Please keep in mind these are not professional actors. We want to give you the opportunity to see how these different scenarios would play out in real world settings. Let's look at a quick scenario of a not-so-awesome troubleshooting interaction, and an awesome one. My computer is broken. Oh, this looks bad. I think you're going to need a new computer. It's going to be about a 1000 bucks. My computer is broken. Oh, okay. Can you tell me a little bit more about how it's broken? Does it turn on at all? Has there been any damage to it lately that you know of? Well, when I hit the power button, I hear a "ding," but nothing comes up on screen. Oh, okay. Can I take a look? Sure. Okay. Let me just see what's going on here. You know what? The brightness was turned down. These brightness buttons are a little bit fiddly, and it's easy to hit them by accident. So, there you are. Great. Thank you. You're welcome. If we didn't ask follow up questions, we wouldn't have realized the issue was something as small as a screen being dim. So, it's important that you're able to gather enough information to start troubleshooting an issue, whether it's big or small. With a little digging, we're able to understand the situation and effectively troubleshoot the issue. What's also really important to call out from the scenario is the tech didn't make the user feel silly for not realizing the screens brightness was down. Can you think about a time someone made you feel silly or even dumb? It's a pretty terrible feeling. So don't be that person that does it to someone else. Remember, IT support is about working in the service of others. Always try to create a positive experience for the user. We'll deep dive into customer service later on. In the meantime, I'll see you back in the next video on isolating the problem.

## 3. Isolating the Problem

Now that we have the ask questions approach nailed down, let's cover another effective troubleshooting method. Isolating the problem. The goal of this method is to shrink the scope of that potential issue. Let's start with a simple game. I have a number I'm thinking of that's less than 100. Can you figure out what it is? You have five questions you can ask me. As you might have guessed, just guessing a number isn't the way to go. Is it five? No. Is it seven? No. Your odds of figuring it out this way are super low. Instead, you should be shrinking the scope of where the number could be. So, you could ask, is it greater than 50? No. Okay. So, we know the number is 50 or less. We've just isolated our problem and cut down half of the answers we started with. To narrow the scope further, you could ask, is it greater than 25? Yes. Is it greater than 38? Yes. Is it lower than 45? Yes. Is the number 42. Yes, the number is 42. Nice work. The power of isolating a problem can quickly and effectively help you figure out where the issue lies. The isolate the problem method is meant to shrink the scope of your problem, so that you know you're looking in the right area. After you continually isolate the problem, you'll eventually end up at the root cause. Root cause is the main factor that's causing a range of issues. Finding root cause is a critical concept in IT support, because it means that you're able to prevent an issue from happening again and again to multiple users. Sometimes the root cause can be difficult to find, an extremely obscure. Don't give up if it isn't immediately obvious. Discovering root cause may be tedious, but it's well worth the effort. Now, let's take a look at a not-so-good and a good example of isolating a problem. Hi Marty, I can't get my email to work on my laptop. Hi Gail. I'd be happy to help with that. Somebody came in the other day with the same problem. Let's uninstall and reinstall the application. It still doesn't work. Hey Marty, I can't get my email to work on my laptop. Oh hey you Gail, sure I'd love to take a look at that. Have you tried checking your mail on your phone, or tablet, or something like that? No, it doesn't look like that's working either. Let me try. Wow. You know I can't get any either. Let me look into this for a sec. It appears that the email server is down. The notice says that it's going to be down for about another hour. How about we wait an hour, try again, and if you're still having problems we can dig deeper. Okay. Thanks Marty. You're welcome Gail. As you can see, it's vital to use the isolating the problem method to decrease the scope of the issue. If you can rule out a problem area to look at, you can troubleshoot more efficiently.

## 4. Follow the Cookie Crumbs

Another effective troubleshooting method is called Follow the cookie crumbs. What purpose does this serve, besides making me want to devour a cookie? Well, this method requires you to go back when the problem first started and work forward from there. You would be surprised how much information you can learn from asking, when did this problem start? Can you help me with my phone, my fun cat app stopped working. Sure. Now what do you mean by stopped working? Well, when I tap on the app, it starts to load and then it crashes. Well, take a look here. Okay, let us try reinstalling the app and see if that helps. It still crashes. I need my fun cat app. Can you help me with my phone, my fun cat app stopped working? Sure, I would be happy to. Can you tell me a little bit more about how it stopped working. Well, when I tap on the app it starts and it just crashes. That is not good. When did it start? Have you changed anything since that time? Well, it worked last night and I was playing around with it until it started to update and this morning it just didn't work. It might have something to do with the update. Let me take a look into it. Okay, it looks like there was a bug in the update. We can roll back to an earlier version and see if that helps. Oh cuddlier peanut, I missed you. The user can give you information about what they remember but the systems you work with can also offer insightful information. In the earlier lessons about operating systems, we talked about logs. Remember that logs are like your system's diary, they keep information about dates and events that happened on the system. You can dig through logs at the exact time that a failure happened and you may find some defining events that could have caused your issue. We will get into logs in more detail in another course. Error messages are super helpful indicators that can point you in the right direction. Lots of times, a single error will be lost in a sea of errors. It is best to start from the very first error which may be causing a cascade of errors. By fixing the root error, you will correct all the other ones in the process. Some errors don't require extra digging, like a 404 not found error. You might see on websites that have been moved or deleted or permission denied error when accessing a protected file. Let's take a look at this log. I see an error message here at the bottom, do you think it makes sense to try and figure out this error message and resolve it? You might find yourself spending all day trying to fix these little holes. Let us backtrack up the log a bit instead. Oh look, we can see where an error first occurred. Let's try to fix this and now our system is not yelling at us anymore.

## 5. Start with the Quikest Step First

We've got some great questions to understand our problem. We've isolated our problem to an effective area and looked at our cookie crumbs. Now it's time to start fixing the issue. In the I.T. world, as in life, problems don't always have one right answer. When you troubleshoot an issue, you're essentially trying to isolate it to the root cause. To help you isolate an issue, you need to try some remediation steps. If they don't work, then you can rule those out as the cause. So what's next? Here's where the Start-with-the- quickest-step-first method comes into play. We want to get to a root cause effectively. But sometimes, there are multiple options we can use to isolate something. So how do we know which option to try first? It's pretty simple. Try whatever's fastest first. I'm having a really weird issue with my software when I start it. It doesn't do anything and I just installed it. Interesting. It might have gotten corrupted during installation. Let's reinstall it again. It still does the same thing. I'm having a really weird issue with my software when I start it. It doesn't do anything. And I just installed it. Do you have to remember if you restarted the computer when you installed it? Oh, it works now. It's possible that in this scenario, a software reinstall could fix the issue. It's also possible that a restart was the solution. Since you can test a restart faster than a reinstall, you should test the restart first. You want to be able to troubleshoot and resolve issues effectively and efficiently. So remember to start with the quickest of first. Your time and your users time are important.

## 6. Troubleshooting Pitfalls to Avoid

You've gained a lot of great foundational troubleshooting skills. But there is some common pitfalls that you should try to avoid in order to be at the top of your troubleshooting game. As an IT support specialist, you'll sometime encounter the same issue over and over again. Before the next issue comes in, you may find yourself using your muscle memory to fix the issue. Pitfall #1, going into autopilot. Make sure you don't default to autopilot mode, moving through issues out of habit and without careful thought. More often than not there are small variables that change the problem you're seeing entirely. Ask questions and gather data so you can fully understanding an issue. This takes less time than having to redo some sloppy work you did in autopilot mode. Pitfall #2, not finding the root cause. It's very easy to get distracted by small problems that pop up. But it's super important to remember there's probably a very big problem causing all these small problems. Spend a little extra time investigating the issue instead of trying to fix all the small holes. If you're trying do a quick fix, it's tempting to wipe a system and start from scratch. This approach is kind of like using a hammer when a surgical scalpel might be a more appropriate tool. Let's say a user isn't able to access a particular website. Re-imaging the system isn't a great solve. It doesn't get to the root cause, and it doesn't help further your own knowledge. Investigating the problem of it, testing out possible issues and solutions incrementally, and identifying the root cause can end up saving a lot of time and effort in the end, and it feels really empowering as an IT support specialist. And with that, you'll be able to go out in the real world and use your new skills to methodically troubleshoot an issue.

## 1. Intro to Soft Skills

Customer service is a critical skill in IT support, I can't emphasize that enough. You can have all the technical knowledge in the world, but if the user had a poor experience in the process of getting their issue solved, you failed. The techniques we'll discuss in these videos won't only help you with your users. They'll help you work better with your peers, you managers, and maybe even your own personal relationships. Keep in mind, these techniques don't work in all situations. The reality is that no matter how great you are at customer service, some situations don't have a good resolution. Plus everyone is different, so you'll need to tweak your style when working with users, but the techniques we'll cover are intended to make your IT interactions more successful. In IT support, you work with users to fix technology and improve how people use it. To accomplish this, you need to develop a trust between you and the user. Lots of employers believe that good customer service also builds brand loyalty, which is a key to success. These lessons are meant to give you the foundational skills and techniques of how to deliver great customer service. Customer service practices can differ from company to company. So while we'll cover the key concepts of customer service in any IT support role, it's important to talk with your employer to understand the company's customer service approach. This will also give you an idea of how much freedom or restrictions you might have in the role. Spoiler alert, great customer service requires exhibiting empathy, being conscious of your tone, acknowledging the person you're talking to and developing trust with the user. If you remember nothing else from this lesson, remember those four things. The most important of all of these is empathy. What's the difference between sympathy and empathy? People will say things like sympathy is saying you're sorry, empathy is feeling sorry. That doesn't really explain it. So let's use an example to drive this home. If someone fell into a dark, damp, dirty hole, and you leaned over with a sad expression and said, that must be a really tough situation, then you're expressing sympathy. You're sharing their feelings, but you aren't experiencing those feelings. If you crawled down into that dark, damp, dirty hole with the person who fell and said, this is a really tough situation, then you're expressing empathy. You're able to see something from someone else's perspective and understand their feelings. The word choice between the two situations is very similar. But the action, the action you take by looking at it from their perspective, is what empathy is all about. Some days it's hard to empathize, I know from experience. Maybe you had an argument with a loved one before work. And by the end of the day, you find yourself getting annoyed or upset with users. That's the moment when empathy becomes the most important, because anyone can showcase empathy when it's easy. But someone who persistently displays empathy will stand out as a kinder human, and a more professional and effective employee. Once you have empathy down, you should think of your tone. Tone is historically thought of as how you speak out loud. In this technological age, when many of our interactions are over text, and IT support is increasingly done remotely, tone isn't just about how you come off during an in-person conversation. It's expanded into how you write, punctuate, and even spell. If your tone is short or blunt, then the user will feel brushed off and devalued. But if your tone is friendly and curious, the user is much more likely to have a positive experience working with you. Be careful not to go overboard with the friendliness though, it could be disingenuous. Communicating a good tone is a delicate balance. How you ask a question and how you respond to a user's question matters. Let's say you tell a user in an email, turn your computer off and on again and it will start working. They'll probably never respond. And your company may have lost a customer, because the tone is just too short and pretty unfriendly. While it gets to the point, it doesn't leave the door open to conversation. What if instead you wrote, please try turning your computer off and back on again. This should update the change we made and fix the problem. If that doesn't work, just let me know. It's a little wordier, but it has a better tone of asking versus telling. Inviting them back to connect with you in case the issue isn't resolved, leaves the lines of communication open. Tone can be especially difficult when you're supporting someone in a different region or country. Make sure to familiarize yourself with the local style, whether that's more conversational or direct, and adjust your style depending on the audience. In this day and age of text and email, it's easy to ignore what someone says. If a comment seems like a dig, or it's just too much information provided, we tend to shy away from responding. It's also really common to forget to tell the user what you're doing while you're troubleshooting, that might leave the user waiting in an awkward silence. Whenever possible, acknowledge the user. This reduces the tension that might build and helps you understand how you're working toward a solution. Let's say your chatting back and forth with the user, you're asking a lot of questions to better troubleshoot the issue. The user's answering them, but also makes comment like, jeez, I already answered these in my last email, or, I just want to know what's causing my problem. You choose to ignore this and continue on with your troubleshooting. You think you're close to solving the problem and these side comments are just a distraction. But then the user stops fully engaging with you and only gives you half-answers to your questions. Now you're not able to solve the issue at all. The user's unhappy, you're unhappy and the company's unhappy. It's a bad situation. Instead of ignoring the user in that situation, you could have said, I'm sorry for asking these questions, sometimes repeating them will help new information pop up. Or, you could have said, sorry for the repeat questions. I don't want to give you a superficial cause, when we could fix the root issue, and you won't have to chat with us again. This helps them to understand your method and become part of the solution. It's important to acknowledge your own actions if you think they might otherwise confuse the user. Let's say a user contacts you to fix something. After collecting some information, you go radio silent. What's the user to do? Would they ask if you're still there? Would they wait awkwardly until you came back on the line? How long would they wait before ending the call or saying something? How would they feel about their interaction with you, pretty awkward. But what if you said, I need to do some research on this issue, would you mind waiting about five minutes or less while I do that? They'd probably say, sure, and keep themselves occupied while they wait. They'd also feel more confident in your ability to resolve the issue. This leads to the most important thing to remember when working with people, and that's developing trust. This is easy to do if you have repeat users. They see you every workday. One bad day isn't going to stop them from trusting that you know what you're doing. But in a transactional userbase, where the user only contacts the company once or twice, how you interact with each user each time is going to break or build that trust. Why is trust so important? Without it, the user could be difficult to work with and could even ignore your advice completely. Empathy and acknowledgement are a big part of building trust. Without these, you'll find it difficult to connect with the user. By seeing things from the user's perspective, you're more likely to find the solution that will help them specifically. This lets them know that you care, and they'll be more likely to be engaged in the interaction. It's also important to follow through on your commitments and promises. If you tell someone you're going to follow up in one hour, then be sure to make it happen. And if you don't, acknowledge the oversight and apologize. Be sure that any claims you make can be backed up. Don't make something up to a user, because you think it'll help in the moment. Be honest with the user, even if you think they won't be happy about it. And never be afraid to admit when you're wrong. This might be the hardest thing to do with a user, but you'll find that your interactions a more successful this way. Being specific and empathetic with your apologies will give it more meaning. And remember, no one wakes up in the morning thinking, I'm going to be a jerk today. While you shouldn't sacrifice your self respect, do your best to give the user the benefit of the doubt whenever possible.

## 2. Anatomy of an Interaction

Now that we've covered the main customer service techniques, we're going to dive in to some of the nitty gritty by looking at the anatomy of an interaction. These apply to any channel of IT support email, phone, chat, or in-person interactions. From the first moment you interact with someone it's important to think about how you say hello. Do you make sure to tell them your name? Do you incorporate information you know about them in your greeting? Do you ensure a positive tone? Are your spelling and grammar on point? These are all ways to create a really good start to the interaction. Some of these things are hard to achieve though. I'm a horrible speller, especially when I'm in a hurry. But knowing some of these trouble spots ahead of time will let you find ways to address them before the interaction. For me, I know that when I'm in a hurry I need to re check my spelling before hitting send. Have you ever heard the phrase first impressions last a lifetime. While that may be a bit of an exaggeration it touches on some truth. How you first interact with someone will influence how the rest of the interaction plays out. I'm not saying it has to be over the top gushy and nice, that might have the opposite effect. Just be professional, acknowledge the user, and show them some respect. Taking the time to get the interaction off to a good start will make everything that comes after easier. Let's check out two scenarios to see how this plays out. >> Hi Gayle, how are you doing? >> Not great, it's been a bad day trying to get my phone fixed. >> What's wrong with your phone? >> Hi Gayle, how are you today. >> Not great, it's been a bad day trying to get my phone fixed. >> Sorry to hear that. Let's see what we can do to turn that around. >> Just by acknowledging their feelings and demonstrat your desire to help them, you've started to build a relationship with the user. Of course you have to keep up the good work throughout the interaction, but laying the ground work is an important first step. And remember that while you might have a hundred issues in the ticket queue that need your attention. This is the only one that matters to the user, so show them it's your priority too. The next critical step in an interaction is how you respond to the users questions. If they are taking the time to explain to you what happened, but you brush off their concerns by acting uninterested, things are going to go south fast. Remember to integrate the information you've been given into your conversation. This will show you're actively listening and can help them feel more connected to the interaction. Let's look at an example. Which one of these greetings do you think is the most effective? Greeting one. Hi Rhori, how are you today? What can I help you with? Or greeting number two. Hi Rhori, I hope you're having a good day, despite your computer randomly turning off. Let's see what we can do to fix your issue. It's important to be transparent with the user. If they start asking you a bunch of questions while you're still troubleshooting, you can do two things. First option, you could ignore them because they're just talking out loud. Second option, you can pause and say something like, I'd be happy to answer all of your questions but I want to look up this one first. I've written them all down though. So I won't forget them. If you say that, make sure to write the questions down. To really build a rapport, try to remember a personal fact that they've mentioned and bring it up later. Maybe they mentioned they loved cats. Later while you're waiting for something to load, ask them if they have any cats or what their cats name is. This shouldn't be forced so if you're not the type to engage in small talk, skip it. Now you're getting to the point where you're ready to troubleshoot. Just make sure you clarify the person's issue before you start to troubleshoot. If you don't, you might find yourself going down a rabbit hole. Imagine that a user tells you their computer can't get online. So you look at the IP address, DNS configuration, and you start paying things with no luck. Everything seems fine. Then, 20 minutes later you find out their machine is online, they just can't access a particular page. Had you clarified this at the start you would have saved yourself, and the user 20 minutes. It seems simple to clarify the problem space, but it's often overlooked. Take this example. >> Thank you for calling, this is Lian. How can I help you? >> Hi Lian, my computer isn't working. >> That doesn't sound fun. What do you mean by the computer isn't working? >> It won't connect to the Internet. >> Do you have the corporate password for the wifi? >> No, why do I need that? >> In order to connect to the wifi in the building, you need to use the corporate password. >> Well, I'm not in the building. I'm at a cafe. >> That's odd, your computer seems to be different than what we normally use. Can I get your name so I can look up your configuration? >> Ling Chan. >> Do you work at this company? >> No, my friend gave me the number. >> Problem solving is a super important aspect of an IT support interaction. Being an IT support specialist means that you could can be asked about anything. Even though you aren't expected to know the answer off the top of your head, you should know where to start looking to find it. People are coming to you because they have a problem they can't fix themselves. Sometimes they feel self-conscious about asking for help, so be aware of how you probe for information. Pummeling the user with question after question will probably create frustration on both sides. Make sure to set context and explain why you're asking the question. Saying something simple like, in order for me to figure out what' really going on, I need to ask you some question, can make all the difference. When you're in person things are a lot easier because you can see each other, and read each other's expression but you might find yourself too comfortable. Imagine you're asking for help with your phone, you wouldn't want the person helping you to just take it out of your hands without asking. So make sure you tell the user what you're doing before you do it. If you're supporting a user remotely and need them to run some commands, don't forget to tell them why you need them to execute the commands. There's no need to go into a ton of detail But without some context you could strain the trust you've built. Make sure that when you're asking these questions or asking the user to run a command you're really listening to the response. Those little nuggets of information may help solve the issue. The last five minutes of the interaction will set the tone for how the user feels walking away from the interaction. So, make sure to end on a positive note. You might have solved their issue, but if they don't feel it was resolved or their unsure of the next steps, then they're going to walk away feeling like it was a poor solution. So how do you make a good final impression? Simple, reiterate the resolution. State the next steps. Then, ask the user if they have any questions.

## 3. How to deal with Difficult Situations

If you've ever worked in customer service, then you've dealt with difficult situations. The way you handle them in the food industry, and tech world are pretty similar. But before we dive into that, we're going to take a step back and talk about the science behind what's happening in these situations. Let's say someone's yelling at you, whether it's about overcooked steak or broken computer, your reaction to either will probably be similar. Your palms might be sweating, your hands might shake, or your mouth goes dry, tunnel vision might kick in. These are all normal physiological reactions that happen in response to a perceived threat. This is part of our biological make up dating back to the time when people hunted for their food. When you're being chased by a cougar, you needed your senses to be at high alert in order to keep yourself alive. Even though someone yelling at you isn't the same as the cougar attacking you, it can feel similar in the moment. Your brain is releasing a mix of chemicals and hormones to heighten your senses and keep you alert. Unfortunately, a side effect is that you may have trouble focusing on a specific task. Not ideal. It's in times like these that you might go on autopilot, where your body has a physical reaction and it's hard to focus. It's super important to recognize these moments and put a plan in place to reboot yourself out of the situation. Sometimes I feel this way when I'm teaching a class and someone is ignoring me. They just don't pay attention. I used to call them out on it. The fight response. But this never ended well. Sometimes they had a good reason for being on their phone, and calling them out never made them listen more. Now when I feel myself in that situation, I notice that my pulse increases. When I realize that's happening, I make sure to look around and focus on people who are more engaged in the lesson, and make eye contact with them. Soon, I feel my pulse slow down. Some of your experiences in IT support might trigger similar reactions. Once you've identified this reboot action, write it down. Remember, your brain isn't always working well in the heat of the moment. So it helps to have something to remind you what to do. It could be anything from squeezing a stress ball, to looking away, to taking a deep breath. The first couple of times it may not work, so give it time. When you have a difficult situation, take a moment to think about what went wrong. How are you feeling? What was your reaction? Why did you raise your voice? After a while, it becomes second nature to catch yourself and deescalate situation. To really hold yourself accountable, tell a coworker what you're trying to do, give them a recap of the interaction, and ask them for their feedback on the interaction. You might get some great tips. But here's the bad news. Things aren't over when you get yourself back on track. That's when the hard work starts. Every situation is different, and you'll learn the best strategies from experience and peer feedback. To get you started, I'll run through some tried and true techniques. Keep in mind that it's fine if you don't get these right the first time. It takes practice, reflection, and feedback to really nail it. So don't give up. The hardest and arguably the best technique, is to identify where the interaction went wrong in the moment and redirect the conversation. This is really tough, because it means remaining calm enough to objectively look at the interaction, and understand what could have caused it to escalate. At first, try this once the interaction is over. You started your chat with the user and it's really pleasant and problem solving is happening. Then suddenly the tone turns dark. What caused it? Where was the misstep? Looking back, you might notice that the user didn't understand the question about what happens when he tries to sync his phone. And the tech just kept repeating it. The user gets annoyed and then starts typing in all caps. A clear sign they're irritated. In this case, the cause seems obvious. If the user didn't understand the question, then they probably got frustrated when the same question was asked over and over. If the IT support specialist had noticed this, they could have reframed the question and broken it down further. Another cause of frustration in user support interactions, is when people talk over each other. This usually happens over the phone, since there is sometimes a delay. But it can happen in person too. Typically, it leads to people talking louder and sometimes ends up feeling like you're yelling at each other. You've probably been in a situation like this with your friends or family. Everyone wants to talk, and the person with the loudest voice wins. How can I help you today? My laptop isn't working, I need a new one. I have meetings I need to go to. I can certainly look into this and see what we can do to fix it. But I want to set context that our policy is to only replace laptops if all other options have been exhausted. I don't need you to go snooping around my computer. Just give me a new one. Gail, I'd love to do that for you, but. That's ridiculous. I'm a director. I should get a new one. I don't have time for this. I completely understand the urgency of the situation. Why don't you let me take a look at. That's why I came. You need to fix it. It's important to try and identify why this is happening, so you can course correct. In this case, you can simply stop talking to calm things down, and then pause for about five or ten seconds to make sure they're done talking and start again. This might take a few tries before the user realizes what they're doing, and gives you time to talk. Use that time to calm down and really listen to what the user is saying. Ask yourself. Why are they talking over me? What am I missing? Then, in those five to 10 seconds, collect yourself and think about what you want to say. How can I help you today. My laptop isn't working. I need a new one. I have meetings I need to go to. I can certainly look into this and see what we can do to fix it. But I want to set context that our policy is to only replace laptops if all other options have been exhausted. I don't need you to go snooping around my computer. Just give me a new one. Gail I'd love to do that for you but. That's ridiculous. I'm a director. I should be able to get a new laptop. I have no time for this. I completely understand. Can you let me have five minutes to do a quick triage, and then we can discuss next steps. If the user is crossing the line and making you feel uncomfortable, ignoring it can feel like the easiest solution. It isn't. Remember that if you do, the next person they interact with, will be treated the same way. And that's not okay. It's also easy to say the person being attacked needs to stand up for themselves. But in situations like this one, that's really hard. Ideally bystanders would call up this behavior in a calm way. It's also important that you escalate these issues to the appropriate channel, whether that's your manager, the human resources department, whomever. Disclaimer, I love being in the IT support field, and I don't want to dwell on the negative. But I do want to prepare you for what you might encounter. So let me throw another tough scenario at you. You might find that a user skims over what you wrote, or doesn't listen to the full instructions you present before taking action. When this happens, be patient. You've likely been on the other end of this before when you ignored instructions. Why? Were you overwhelmed with information? Were you in a hurry? Maybe you need reading glasses. Whatever the case might be, the best tactic is to break these steps down into smaller more digestible pieces for the user. If you sent them an article that they didn't finish reading, ask where specifically in the documentation they're having issues. So that you don't have to bore them with the parts they already know. Sometimes you'll come across someone wanting to bend a policy or push back on an established process. Take this as a sign to look deeper into the situation. Is it really a company policy, or just a common way of doing things? If it is the policy, is there documentation of it? You can reference that to the user. If not, offer to follow up to get a definitive answer. You might be surprised what you find. The takeaway here is, that it's important to try to see things from other people's point of view. In that moment, when you're feeling riled up and frustrated, take a minute to see the situation from the other person's perspective. If you are them, how would you be feeling? What would make you feel better? If you can train yourself to see things from another's perspective, you're on your way to turning things around.

## 1. Ticketing Systems and Documenting Your Work

Have you ever worked hard on something that had a lot of steps and took a long time, only to have to do it again three months later? And completely forgotten everything you did? Well, that happens all the time in the IT world. That's why it's important to document the work you do. Documentation might seem like a time suck, but it's a total time saver. There are two main ways we document information in the IT industry. The first is through ticketing or bug system. Tickets are a common way of documenting an issue. Bugs are issues with the system that weren't caused by external source. Imagine, if every time something broke you receive an e-mail. That'd be hard to keep track of and not scalable at all. The IT industry utilizes systems just to keep track of this for you. Some examples are Bugzilla, JIRA, and Redmine. These are all-in-one solutions that help you track user issues, communicate with your users, and provide updates. A great way to use the system for documentation is to update the ticket with what the issue is, the steps and procedures you're trying to resolve, and the solution you arrived at. This is important for two reasons. The first, is that it keeps the user in the loop. The second, is that it helps you audit your steps in case you need to go back and see what you did. You can also write down procedures and policies to create a documentation trail. You have a lot of options of where you want to write, and store your documentation. You can keep your policies and procedures in a document webpage through online file storage, or lots of other mediums. Just make sure it's accessible to everyone else in your company. If you have a monthly reoccurring task, like updating old software on machines, make sure to write down all the steps and then refer back to them when it's needed. Documentation isn't a set it and forget it situation. Systems and processes are constantly changing, and so should your documentation. It's important to update documentation. So that you aren't reading something that's old. One last thing I want to call out about writing documentation is that you don't need to get creative with your writing. You aren't writing a short story. You're writing a technical document. You want to be as concise as possible. So that when someone reads your document, they can easily figure out what they need to do.

## 2. Process Documentation

Let us take a look at examples of good and not-so-good documentation. Here is the deal. You encounter a strange issue when helping a user out. This issue happens so often that you and your colleagues have encountered it. No documentation is the worse documentation. Imagine if it took you hours to figure out an issue to a problem and you didn't write it down. Your colleague encounters the same issue and takes hours to figure it out. Then, he also does not write it down. This can go on and on. It only takes a little bit of effort to create documentation, and it can save you so much of your time, your company's time, and your users time. Okay. This is not the best example of documentation. The problem the IT support specialist stated is not specific, and it leaves you with more questions than answers. And while it tells you what will fix an issue, it does not tell you how. Documentation should be straight and clear-cut. Your reader should not have any questions when following the instructions you listed. Now, this is a good example of documentation. It starts off with a very specific and clear problem. It gives you background information on what the issue is. It even gives you the exact instructions on how to fix the issue, including which settings to navigate to and where. Remember, always write documentation that makes it easy for your reader to follow.

## 3. Documenting in Ticketing Systems

Now that we've talked a little bit about documenting processes, let's talk about how you'll write documentation in ticketing or bug system. You don't have to leave a full example of process documentation for every ticket you handle. If you encounter the same issue, just write the documentation once, then refer back to it. One of the more important aspects of writing documentation in a ticket or bug is that you leave an audit trail to see what worked and what didn't. Let's take a look at some examples of awesome documentation and not-so-awesome documentation in ticketing and bug systems. This isn't helpful at all, since we don't know what the issue was, or what the IT support specialist did to fix it. If someone stumbled upon this ticket with the same issue, it would be pretty useless. This is an example of a great ticket documentation. A tech described what the issue is, what caused the issue, and the specific steps they took to resolve it.

## 1. Your Opportunity for Success

Hi there. My name is Rob Clifton, and I'm a Program Manager at Google. My career in IT started about 17 years ago. At the time, my IT knowledge was mainly self-taught. I took certificate courses much like this one, and learned as much as I could along the way, while I continued to go to college part-time to get an associate's degree. Finding that first job wasn't easy. I had to convince someone to take a chance on me, even though I had no degree and no advanced education in IT. I applied for a lot of jobs, got a few interviews, received a lot of rejections, and eventually landed my first job fixing computers at a big-box retailer. Over the next few years, I jumped around a different jobs, getting more experience while I continued to go to school, and finish my degree. I eventually landed at Google as a support tech in our Ann Arbor office. Twelve years later, I now lead the hiring efforts for our junior IT support roles. I've interviewed hundreds of candidates, and I help train our interviewers in how to find the best talent in the industry. Today, I'm excited to share what I've learned to help you prepare for your next interview. Going into an interview is a moment that lots of people dread. We're all afraid that we could say something wrong, that we're not ready for that next step, or just that we'll be rejected. These are all normal feelings, but it helps to look at the interview as an opportunity. It's an opportunity for you to hone your interpersonal skills, learn more about the company, and make sure that the job is a good fit for you. It is an opportunity to advance your career and gain more work experience. During these lessons, we'll give you some tips that'll help you prepare for the interview. We want you to walk in to your interviews feeling confident and excited. In later courses, we'll also add a few role-playing exercises where we'll show you what a technical interview on the subject at hand may look like.

## 2. Standing out from the Crowd

To land an interview for a job you want, make sure your resume in online professional presence are in order. This will help you stand out from the other applicants when you apply. Your resume is your first introduction to a new company. Make sure your resume is easy to read and clearly shows the recruiter or hiring manager that you're a strong fit for the job you're applying for. Avoid using lots of filler text in your resume. If you're new to the industry, you may not have a lot to put on your resume but that's okay, you don't need to list out every piece of software you've used or networking protocol you've ever learned about, stick to your relevant qualifications. Use a standard resume template and be consistent with your formatting and structure. Proofread your resume and have someone else review it too. You don't want grammar and spelling errors to be your first impression with a potential employer. There's a lot more to say about resumes, so I've included more material in the supplemental reading. You should also make sure you have an up-to-date online presence. Your profile should look professional and have the most current resume, a photo, and updated contact info. Don't forget to do this, employees are using sites like Linkedin more and more to reach out to candidates. Now, when you find a job that you want to apply for you want to learn as much as you can about the role. First place defines information is in the job description. The description will usually include the roles, responsibilities and requirements and some information about the company. Take some time to understand those details and make sure it's a good fit for you. Feel free to ask your recruiter any additional questions you have about the role or the company. Knowing these expectations and requirements will also help you prepare for the interview. For any IT role, make sure that you know the fundamentals of it really well and spend extra time reviewing any specific areas that are called out in the job description. This program will get you started with some of those fundamentals like networking and operating systems but you'll still need to do some research on your own. On top of this specific job requirements, you should also take time to research the company that you're applying to. Learn about the main characteristics of the company, what their primary products or services are, who their customers are and where they're located. Look for things that are new, interesting and exciting about the company's future. Try to learn about some of the challenges the company might be facing. If the company has a code of conduct or mission statement online, make sure to read it as it will illustrate what the company prioritizes. Knowing the company's values will help you decide whether it's a company you want to work for. Some of these facts may come up during your interview either as part of a scenario or to question by itself. So you want to be prepared. Lastly, once you have interview schedule, make sure you know where to go when you need to be there and what the appropriate attire is for the interview. This particular tip was especially important for me when I first interviewed with Google. At the time, Google was in a temporary space above a restaurant in Ann Arbor, a town I was not very familiar with, there is no sign or address. So when I got there I had no idea where to go. Thankfully I ride with some time to spare. So when I got to the right block for the address went around to the back alley found the address on the fire escape and climbed at the second floor. The door was open and the woman behind it was a little surprised to see me entering. Everyone had a bit of a laugh and I told him I couldn't find the front entrance and I didn't want to be late for my interview. To this day my manager still talks about my entrance and says it showed him I was resourceful and determine, who knows maybe that's why they decide to give me the job.

## 3. Getting Ready for the Interview

A lot of us are quite nervous when we go through our first interviews. There are a lot of things at stake, and it might be hard not to freak out. But don't panic. You can do this if you prepare. With interviews, as with lots of other things in life, practice makes perfect. In order to get this practice, try doing mock interviews. Pretending that you're in an interview, even if it's not real, will help you perform your best. You'd be more comfortable thinking out loud and providing clear answers to complicated questions. To do these mock interviews, recruit a friend or family member that's willing to practice with you. Even if they don't know the actual content, they can still help you get into interview mode. By practicing, you get used to articulating yourself clearly, which is key to nailing an interview. It's not just about knowing the answers, you also need to show your ideas clearly and concisely. For example, take some general technical subjects like DHCP, DNS, Active Directory or any other technical area you've learned about. Have a friend or family member ask you to explain the concept to them. What's it for? How is it used? Practicing explanations for non-technical audience will get you used to breaking down complicated ideas and sharing them in basic terms. They can also create their own troubleshooting scenarios, like asking you to explain what you did the last time you fixed their printer or got their network online. While you're practicing answering questions, you should also practice active listening habits. Maintain eye contact with the other person, nod in understanding when they speak, and ask relevant follow-up questions. If you can, it's great to practice with someone who also plans to interview for similar roles. This way, you can take turns being the interviewer and the interviewee. This will allow you to put yourself in the interviewer's shoes, and understand how best to answer each question. Now keep in mind, I don't recommend trying to script or memorize all of your answers. Instead, try explaining the same concepts in different ways. This allows for more natural conversation, and will help you adapt your answers in the actual interview where you won't know the questions. What you can write down and memorize is your elevator pitch. An elevator pitch is a short summary of who you are and what kind of career you're looking for. Make sure to include information like what you're passionate about, how you would like to grow, and what you're looking for in a new role. Practice delivering this pitch to different people and see how it sounds. Even if you haven't memorized, stay flexible. You never know in which context you may need it. Reading your first elevator pitch from scratch can be hard. I've included a few examples in the next supplemental reading. When developing your own, make sure that you keep it personal. Again, key to getting interviews right is to practice. This will help you feel less nervous and show your best self during the actual interviews.

## 4. What to Expect During the Technical Interview

When you're interviewing for a technical position, you'll likely have one or more interviews where you'll specifically need to demonstrate your technical skills and knowledge. These interviews may take the form of technical troubleshooting scenarios or explanations of technical concepts and subjects. As we've said, you'll want to have a solid foundation for all the fundamental concepts. Different courses in this program will help introduce you to a variety of concepts related to networking, operating systems, system administration, and security. A good interviewer will push you to the limits of your knowledge. This means it's very likely that during an interview, you'll reach a point you're not sure you know the right answer. This is expected, but you shouldn't just say, "I don't know." If you are supporting a user, you wouldn't say it then either. It's okay to admit you're not sure, but you should then explain what you would do to find the answer. As an IT support specialists, you should expect to often face new and unfamiliar problems. Having a good problem-solving strategy is more important than knowing all the answers. If the question you're answering is big and complex, outline how you would break down the work needed to solve the problem before going into the exact details of what needs to be done. If you're thinking about what the best solution could be, share your train of thought with your interviewer, so they can follow along. Thinking aloud not only helps the interviewer see your thought process, but it also helps you work through the problem. For example, if you get stuck with the technical troubleshooting scenario, you can try to recap what information you've gathered and state potential causes that can be ruled out with certainty and then try to figure out what info is still missing to rule out other causes. When you mentioned concepts or technologies, you should be ready to explain them and articulate why you may choose one thing over another. For instance, if you're working through a networking problem and say something like, "The problem might be related to the DNS settings," be ready to explain what DNS is and why it relates to the issue. You should also clarify the questions constraints, don't assume anything. It's okay, and even expected, to ask the interviewer follow-up questions to ensure that the problem is correctly framed. Always use the data and evidence you have from the interviewer to inform your next steps. For example, if you need to solve a problem about a user being unable to connect to an internal system, you should ask follow-up questions like what operating system the user is using, how the computer is supposed to connect to the network, what kind of error messages they're getting, whether other users are affected. Your goal is to narrow the scope to find the root cause. If the question is very complex, it might become difficult to follow or explain the solution. In this case, it's useful to take notes and use diagrams to illustrate the problem. You can use this process when it makes sense. It doesn't mean you need to write everything down during an interview. Sometimes the answer is straightforward, and you can just go ahead and explain it without writing anything down.

## 5. Showing your best self during the Interview

Being your best self at the interview starts the night before. Being fully rested will help you have more energy, be more focused, and minimizing anxiety. So, make sure that you get a good night's sleep. Don't try to cram in any last minute studying, this will only make you more anxious. Instead, try to relax and go to bed early. On the day of the interview, eat a proper breakfast. It's never a good idea to be hungry during an interview. Aim to arrive earlier than the scheduled time, and give yourself enough travel time for any mishaps along the way. Make sure you're comfortable before you begin the actual interview. Don't be afraid to ask for something if you need it. Use the restroom, grab a glass of water, and asked for a note pad and pen for notes or to illustrate answers when necessary. Be fully present for the duration of the interview. This means turning off your phone to avoid interruptions and giving the interviewer your full attention. Use those active listening skills that you've practiced. Make eye contact, nod to indicate understanding, and ask follow-up questions. Don't forget to be yourself. You want the interviewer to remember you, so let your personality show. Make sure that you highlight what makes you unique. Remember that the interview is also an opportunity for you to ask questions about the things that you care about. You're interviewing them as much as they're interviewing you. Find out if this is a company that you want to work for and whether you'll be able to achieve your career goals there. Finally, remember to slow down. Most people start talking faster and faster when they're nervous, so be aware of your pace. If you notice that you're getting nervous, pause for a moment to take a few deep breaths, and then consciously slow down. Woah, that's a lot of tips to remember. Feel free to re-watch these videos when your next interview is approaching to make sure that you have these ideas fresh in your mind. Next up, together with Candace, a colleague of mine, we'll do the first of our role-playing exercises, showing some of these tips in action.

## 6. Interview Role Play

All right, thanks for coming in. Before I jump in my technical questions, I'd like to know a bit more about you. Tell me why you're interested in this position. When I came in to college, I was a pre-med major and eventually I led down the path to take a introduction to IT course. Out of that course, I realize how impactful IT was and I became more curious to how computers work and why do they break. So, I changed my major to IT after that class. After two years of being in the major, I got a job at the IT service center where I was able to help students with their computer issues. So, I believe having the job will allow me to advance my knowledge in troubleshooting skills and then also I'll be able to learn new things. Cool. Can you tell me what in particular you find appealing about IT? I like IT because it allows me to be very creative and they also allows me to hone in on those problem-solving skills. Also, I like IT because it's very broad. So, I feel like the trajectory of my career could be in multiple IT fields such as like database management, software engineering, IT support and networking. That's awesome. All right. Well, let's get started with our first question then. Let's say that you're the only person supporting a help desk and you're currently helping me with an issue. When a VP walks in and they ask you for help and they say they have a presentation to give in 15 minutes, how would you handle this situation? So, I want to prioritize issues based on severity. It seems like the VP, the issue is a little bit more time-sensitive. So, I will ask you if it's okay if I will help out the VP. Okay. That's fair. I'm okay with that. Now, how would you help the VP? So, I want to get the VP up and running as soon as possible. So, I'll offer them a spare laptop and in the meantime I'll be able to fix their computer while they're at their meeting. Okay. Great. So, now let me rewind for a second. Let me change things up. So, what if you were helping me and my issue was actually very critical and it was part of a larger issue that was affecting a number of users, say, maybe our wireless network was having issues. How would you handle that? So, if I was able to help the VP right away like by offering a spare laptop then I would do that. But if that's not the case then I'd have to let the VP know that the issue that I'm dealing with is a little bit more severe because it affects the business and I hope the VP will be a little bit more understanding and I will probably have to have a co-worker come and help the VP or I could tell the VP to probably like reschedule their meeting, if that's possible. Great. Yeah, I think that's fair and you're right. We should take into account what's most important to the business in that type of scenario. So, good job. So in this scenario, we saw Candice deliver elevator pitch and show why she's passionate about IT and becoming an IT support specialist. We also saw one typical complication of troubleshooting problems, getting priorities right. Time sensitive issues usually have higher priority but issues that are preventing a large number of users from getting work done should be dealt with first even if the person asking for help is a director or a VP. That's it for now. See you again at the end of the next course.

## 7. Rob finding a great candidate

The potential, and the ambition, the passion, and the smarts, are more important than the specific piece of knowledge that you might have. There was this one particular candidate that just always stands out, and I use him in so many different examples. He was going to be a doctor and realized he didn't want to do that, and had worked maybe one type of help desk job at university. I remember I was asking him some networking questions, and it was clear that he didn't have the experience. But I could tell that he had the smarts, and that he had the passion and the ambition. It came out so clearly to me, because he was able to break things down, and logically guess how something would work. So, I would give them a little piece of information and he will be able to take that, and say, "Oh, I think it might work this way, even though I'm not sure." He was very honest, he was very polite, he was very forthcoming, and I just immediately loved him. I was just like, "I have to hire this person." We hired him and we were a little concerned because he was a little bit more junior than rest of the folks on the team. But within six months, he knew more than anybody else on the team, just because he took that same, sort of, approach. It was that passion and those smarts that he had that just wowed us. He's probably one of the brightest people I've ever met, and, sort of, helps build that philosophy, that I now have around hiring.

## 8. Module Wrap up

Always remember, that people use technology to make their lives better, easier and more productive. They can get discouraged, angry or frustrated when the technology which they may not fully understand. Doesn't respond like they expect as an I.T. support specialist, you have the opportunity to leverage your technical knowledge, to fix the problem and understand impact that issue might have on the user. This means, you're uniquely positioned to directly improve people's lives. You'll solve technical problems and make them feel better in the process. The skills you learned in this module, should benefit you throughout your entire career in the I.T. world. As you know by now, to be great at customer service sometimes you need to take a moment to pause, reflect and listen. How about we give that a shot now. Stop what you're doing for a minute and think about what you've achieved. You're so close to finishing this course, you should be really proud of the time and effort you've put in to prepare for a career in I.T. support. Now there's just one more thing to check off. We're going to test what you've learned in our lesson on documentation. Be sure to take your time and think through all the different steps in the problem. You've got this.
